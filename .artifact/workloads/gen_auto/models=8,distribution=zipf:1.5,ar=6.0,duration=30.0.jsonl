{"id": 71, "prompt": "USER: Explain this:\n\"Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\"\nASSISTANT:", "timestamp": 11.84907874274058, "model": "delta-6", "min_tokens": 241, "max_tokens": 241}

{"id": 74, "prompt": "USER: Explain this:\nLarge pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zeroshot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were\nnot explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative\nASSISTANT:", "timestamp": 12.854853899088862, "model": "delta-5", "min_tokens": 225, "max_tokens": 225}

{"id": 173, "prompt": "USER: Provide the implementation, in the shape of code snippets with comments, to train a model using TypeScript to predict the thickness of a new coating. For training the model, we'll use a dataset of FTIR data from various coatings, and we'll consider all the columns except \"code\" and those that start with the prefix \"MD_\". Normalize the data and remove empty values before training. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and ease of use over performance. Implement the model in a node backend and train it on demand. The minimum acceptable accuracy should be prioritized over performance. Use the R-squared metric to evaluate the model's performance and provide a simple visualization or report for the model's performance. The prediction results should show the predicted thickness value together with its probability. Think step by step and make sure there are no errors.\n\nAdditionally, provide a code snippet showcasing how to use model from nodejs once it has been trained.\n\nExample dataset:\n\ncode\tP_706\tP_729\tP_762\tP_814\tP_876\tP_915\tP_1046\tP_1087\tP_1101\tP_1116\tP_1131\tP_1200\tP_1232\tP_1265\tP_1310\tP_1323\tP_1390\tP_1452\tP_1469\tP_1480\tP_1554\tP_1562\tP_1629\tP_1640\tP_1649\tP_1679\tP_1690\tP_1750\tP_1851\tP_1860\tP_1873\tP_1884\tMD_Project\tMD_Sample\tMD_ProjectFase\tMD_Layer\tMD_FTIRinterface\tMD_RepetitionNum\tMD_PrimerTemp\tMD_TopCoatTemp\tMD_PrimerTime\tMD_TopCoatTime\tMD_PrimerThickness\tMD_TopCoatThickness\n0\t2.905\t3.27\t1.958\t1\t1.893\t1.848\t3.225\t3.005\t3.051\t3\t2.958\t3.88\t3.649\t4.435\t3.882\t3.991\t4.051\t3.578\t3.742\t3.969\t3.867\t4.034\t2.31\t2.381\t2.\nASSISTANT:", "timestamp": 29.088338466612143, "model": "delta-6", "min_tokens": 500, "max_tokens": 500}
