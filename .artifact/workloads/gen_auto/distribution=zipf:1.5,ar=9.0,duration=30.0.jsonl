{"id": 71, "prompt": "USER: Explain this:\n\"Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\"\nASSISTANT:", "timestamp": 7.8993858284937115, "model": "delta-8", "min_tokens": 241, "max_tokens": 241}

{"id": 74, "prompt": "USER: Explain this:\nLarge pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zeroshot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were\nnot explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives\nused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited\nsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale\nevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In\nparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with\ntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train\nmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby\nincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.\nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization\nafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed\nby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore\nconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.\nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant\ngenerative\nASSISTANT:", "timestamp": 8.569902599392567, "model": "delta-1", "min_tokens": 225, "max_tokens": 225}

She was a bright and curious student with a passion for science and technology.\nOne sunny afternoon, as Sophie was walking back from her science lab, she noticed a strange object in the sky. It was a spaceship, hovering above the college campus. She rubbed her eyes, thinking she was hallucinating, but the spaceship was still there when she looked back.\nSuddenly, a beam of light shot out from the spaceship, hitting Sophie directly in the stomach.

Susie was known throughout her village for her beauty, her kind heart, and her love of sweets.\nOne day, as she was walking through a nearby forest, she stumbled upon a hidden path that led her to an enchanted world called Cotton Candy Land. The ground was made of fluffy pink cotton candy, the trees were made of peppermint sticks, and the rivers were made of chocolate syrup. Everywhere Susie looked, there were sweets of all kinds, from gummy bears to lollipops to chocolate truffles.\nOverwhelmed with delight, Susie began to explore this magical land. She wandered through fields of sugary flowers, climbed candy-coated mountains, and swam in rivers of hot fudge. But no matter where she went, she couldn't resist the temptation to taste everything around her. She nibbled on cotton candy clouds, licked lollipops as big as her head, and devoured candy canes as tall as trees.\nAs the hours passed, Susie's belly began to feel full and heavy. But she couldn't stop eating.\nASSISTANT:", "timestamp": 26.181895719943302, "model": "delta-6", "min_tokens": 9, "max_tokens": 9}
