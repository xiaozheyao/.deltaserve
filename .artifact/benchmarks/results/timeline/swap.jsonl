This can be done by splitting the neural network into smaller subnetworks, and processing each subnetwork in parallel.\n3. Hybrid parallelism: This involves combining data and model parallelism, by sharding the input data and the network architecture across multiple processors or GPUs.\n\nThe specific approach used to parallelize a neural network will depend on the hardware being used, the size of the network, and the specific performance requirements of the application. It is often necessary to experiment with different parallelization strategies to determine the most effective approach for a given problem.
