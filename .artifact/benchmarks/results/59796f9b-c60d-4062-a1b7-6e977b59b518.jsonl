It was developed in the early 20th century as a way to reconcile the classical mechanics of Newton with the wave-like behavior of particles observed in experiments.\n\nAt the quantum level, particles are described by wave functions that give the probability of finding the particle at a particular point in space. These wave functions are complex and depend on the energy and momentum of the particle.\n\nOne of the most important principles of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously determined with complete accuracy. This means that the behavior of particles at the quantum level is inherently probabilistic and can appear to be random or unpredictable.\n\nQuantum mechanics also describes the interactions of particles through forces, which are governed by a set of mathematical rules known as Feynman diagrams. These forces can be either attractive or repulsive and are responsible for the stability of atoms and the behavior of subatomic particles in experiments.\n\nQuantum mechanics has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and has led to the development of many new technologies, including computers, lasers, and semiconductors.
