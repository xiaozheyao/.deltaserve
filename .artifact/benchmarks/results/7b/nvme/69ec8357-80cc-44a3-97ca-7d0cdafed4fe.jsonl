It is based on the principle that particles can exist in multiple states, known as superposition, and can be entangled with each other.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum mechanics is that particles can exist in more than one place at the same time. This is known as superposition, and it is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. Superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, which means that they can be in a state of potentiality, meaning that they are not yet actually present somewhere, and they can also be in a state of actuality, meaning that they are actually present somewhere.\n\nAnother important principle of quantum mechanics is that particles can be entangled with each other, meaning that their quantum states are linked together in a way that can be described mathematically. This means that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, and they cannot be described independently of each other.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concept of wave-particle duality, which means that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.
