This is in contrast to classical physics, which predicts the exact position and velocity of objects at all times.\n\nAt the heart of quantum mechanics is the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that particles can behave both as waves and as particles. This means that particles can exist in multiple states at once and that their behavior is determined by probabilities rather than definite outcomes.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is superposition, which refers to the ability of particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. For example, an electron can be in multiple energy levels at the same time.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduced the concept of entanglement, which refers to the phenomenon where two particles become \"entangled\" in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances.\n\nQuantum mechanics has had a profound impact on our understanding", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715026105.7188892, "last_token_time": 1715026459.865055, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715026108.1714861, "cpu_loading_time": 1715026123.644588, "gpu_loading_time": 1715026123.6817527, "first_token_time": 1715026239.90402, "time_in_queue": 2.45259690284729, "finished_time": 1715026459.8650398}]}, "end_at": 4604627.789247023, "start_at": 4604273.632080119}
