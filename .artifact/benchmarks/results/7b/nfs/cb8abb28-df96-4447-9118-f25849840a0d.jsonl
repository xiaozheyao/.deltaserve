This means that the location and momentum of a particle can be described by a wave function, which is a mathematical function that describes the probability of finding the particle at a particular point in space and time.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts the existence of phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, which are not observed in classical physics.
