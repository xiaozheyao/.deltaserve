Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at a very small scale, where the classical laws of physics no longer apply.\n\nIn classical physics, the behavior of objects is described by a set of rules known as Newton's laws, which state that an object will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. In quantum mechanics, however, the behavior of particles is described by a set of probability waves that indicate the likelihood of finding the particle at a given point in space.\n\nOne of the key concepts in quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality, which suggests that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the conditions under which they are observed. For example, particles can be described in terms of wave functions that give the probability of finding the particle at a given point in space.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely the position and momentum of a particle can be determined simultaneously.
