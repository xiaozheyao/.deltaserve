The pre-trained model can then be used for downstream tasks, such as language generation or machine translation, with improved efficiency and accuracy. The LoRA technique has been shown to outperform other techniques for reducing the size of large language models, while still maintaining their performance.

It was developed in the early 20th century as a way to explain the wave-like properties of particles, such as electrons and photons, which were not fully accounted for by classical physics.\n\nAt the heart of quantum mechanics is the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the circumstances. This allows for phenomena such as quantum tunneling, where a particle passes through a barrier that it should not be able to penetrate according to classical physics.\n\nAnother important aspect of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with complete accuracy. This has implications for issues such as the measurement of time and the nature of reality itself.\n\nQuantum mechanics also provides a framework for describing the interactions between particles, through processes such as scattering and fusion. It has led to many discoveries, such as the existence of subatomic particles and the development of new materials with unique properties.\n\nOverall, quantum mechanics is a highly successful andwell-established theory that has had a profound impact on our understanding of the physical world.

This function uses recursion and laziness to compute the Fibonacci sequence without producing a stack overflow. Note that this function does not terminate if `n` is too large, so it's better to put a cap on the number of terms you want to compute. You can do this by adding a default value to the function parameter, like this:\n```ruby\n(defn fibonacci [n default]\n  (if (<= n 2)\n    [n n]\n    (lazy (cons (fibonacci (dec n)) (fibonacci (dec n))))))\n```\nNow you can call `fibonacci` with any positive integer `n` and get the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence, or pass a default value for `n` to get all the terms. For example, to get the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence, you can call:\n```scss\n(take 10 (fibonacci 10))\n```\nOr, to get all the Fibonacci terms up to a certain value, you can use:\n```scss\n(doall (fibonacci 1000000000))\n```\nNote that this implementation of the Fibonacci sequence is not efficient for large values of `n`, as it computes the Fibonacci numbers one by one", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715375704.9968672, "last_token_time": 1715375881.6335723, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715375705.0142674, "cpu_loading_time": 1715375705.016692, "gpu_loading_time": 1715375705.0167124, "first_token_time": 1715375705.7796054, "time_in_queue": 0.017400264739990234, "finished_time": 1715375881.633568}]}, "end_at": 8603311.55747531, "start_at": 8603024.06022622}

By censoring certain content, platforms can help prevent the spread of misinformation and protect users from harm.\n* Online harassment and hate speech have become increasingly prevalent on social media, particularly with the rise of identity politics and political polarization. Censoring certain types of content can help reduce the incidence of harassment and hate speech, making the platform a safer space for users.\n* Social media censorship can help protect the privacy and security of users by removing certain types of content that could be used to identify or harm individuals.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\n* Censorship raises concerns about free speech and the potential for government overreach and abuse of power.\n* The line between acceptable and unacceptable content can be subjective and open to interpretation, leading to inconsistencies and arbitrary decisions.\n* Social media platforms have a responsibility to regulate their own content, but ultimately, the decision to censor should be left to the users themselves, who can choose to follow or unfollow certain accounts based on their content.\n* Censorship can also stifle creativity and expression, and contribute to a culture of self-censorship.\n\nOverall, social media censorship is a complex issue with both pros and cons. While it may be necessary in some cases to protect users from harm or misinformation, it is also important to ensure that free speech is protected and that censorship is not used as a tool for political censorship. It's important to strike a balance between censorship and freedom of speech, and to ensure that the decision to censor content is made with transparency and accountability.\n\n\ubc88\uc5ed\uacb0\uacfc  \n\uc11c\uc220 \ucc2c \uc0ac\ud68c \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc800", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 436}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715375710.9011803, "last_token_time": 1715375888.592959, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715375710.9191577, "cpu_loading_time": 1715375710.9221456, "gpu_loading_time": 1715375710.9221675, "first_token_time": 1715375711.6489902, "time_in_queue": 0.017977476119995117, "finished_time": 1715375888.5929377}]}, "end_at": 8603318.51746628, "start_at": 8603039.662881134}

Let's call the length of the hypotenuse y.\n\nSince the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1 : 2, we can set up the following equation:\n\ny = x + 2x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n3x = y\n\nNow, we can use the length of the altitude to solve for the length of the hypotenuse. We know that the length of the altitude is 6 cm, so we can substitute this value into the above equation:\n\n6 = 3x\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\nx = 2\n\nSo the longer segment of the hypotenuse is twice as long as the shorter segment.

One such mechanism, called Hyena, has been proposed in this research paper. Hyena is a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention that combines long convolutions and data-controlled gating. This allows Hyena to achieve similar accuracy to attention-based models, while using less computational resources.\n\nIn language modeling tasks, Hyena was able to set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures, reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K.
