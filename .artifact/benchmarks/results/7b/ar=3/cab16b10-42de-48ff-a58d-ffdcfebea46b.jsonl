This allows the model to learn a hierarchy of abstractions, with the shells representing increasingly specific or complex features of the input language. Lora is important for enabling efficient training and inference of large language models on devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones or edge servers. It is also useful for mitigating the effects of catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks, where previous knowledge is lost during training on new tasks.

It is based on the idea that these particles do not exist in a definite location or momentum until they are observed, and that the act of observation can affect the particle's behavior.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the situation. This means that a particle can be in multiple places at once, and its position can be probed by a wave of probability, known as the wave function.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is superposition, which refers to the idea that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and that a measurement will cause the system to collapse into a single state. This can be visualized as a coin that is in a superposition of being heads and tails until it is flipped, at which point it will land on one of these two states.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts the existence of quantum entanglement, which occurs when two particles become correlated in such a way that they can instantaneously affect each other, even when separated by a large distance.

If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 1, because the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Otherwise, the function diagonalizes the problem by recursively computing the (n-1)-th and (n-1)-th Fibonacci numbers, `a` and `b`, and then returns their sum, `a + b`.\n\nThe `fibonacci` function is \"lazy\" in the sense that it only computes the sequence as far as `n` is larger than 2. If you call `fibonacci` with a small enough `n`, the function will return 1 immediately without any further computation. As `n` increases, the function will start computing the corresponding Fibonacci numbers and returning their sums, one at a time. This approach can be more efficient than computing the entire Fibonacci sequence in memory at once, especially for large `n`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `fibonacci` function in a Clojure program:\n```clojure\n(defn main []\n  (println (fibonacci 10)))\n```\nIn this example, we define a `main` function that calls the `fibonacci` function with an argument of 10.

Combating misinformation: Social media platforms have become a hotbed for the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can have serious consequences for public health and safety. Censorship can help to remove harmful content and limit its reach.\n2. Protecting individuals: Social media platforms can also be used to bully, harass, and intimidate individuals, particularly those who are marginalized or vulnerable. Censorship can help to protect individuals from online abuse and ensure that they can use social media in a safe and secure manner.\n3. Promoting community standards: Social media platforms have their own community standards and guidelines that they are expected to follow. Censorship can help to ensure that these standards are upheld and that content that violates them is removed from the platform.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\n1. Free speech concerns: Censorship raises concerns about freedom of speech and the ability of individuals to express themselves online without fear of retribution. It can also be used to silence dissenting voices and suppress political opposition.\n2. Technical difficulties: Censoring content on social media can be difficult, as the platforms use complex algorithms to determine what content is appropriate and what is not. This can lead to false positives and false negatives, where content that should be allowed is removed or content that should be removed is allowed to remain.\n3. Promoting self-regulation: Rather than relying on censorship, social media platforms should be encouraged to develop their own community guidelines and to enforce them through moderation and user reporting. This approach allows for greater transparency and accountability, and can help to foster a more inclusive and diverse online community.\n\nNote: It is important to note that censorship is not a black and white issue and the merits of censorship vs non-censorship can vary in different contexts and on different platforms.
