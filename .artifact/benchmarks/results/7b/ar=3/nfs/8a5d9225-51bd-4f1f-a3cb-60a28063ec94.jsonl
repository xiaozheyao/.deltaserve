This is described by the Schrodinger equation, which governs the behavior of a quantum system.\n\nIn addition to wave-particle duality, quantum mechanics includes several other fundamental concepts, such as superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty principle. These concepts describe how quantum systems can exist in multiple states at the same time, how they can be instantly connected no matter how far apart they are, and how their behavior is inherently random and unpredictable.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts a number of phenomena that are not observable in classical mechanics, such as the phenomenon of tunneling, where particles pass through barriers that classical mechanics says they should not be able to penetrate.\n\nQuantum mechanics has had a huge impact on the development of technology, including the development of transistors, lasers, and computer chips, and continues to be an active area of research today.

It uses a recursive function to compute the sequence, starting with the initial values of 0 and 1.\n\nThe function uses the `if` expression to check if `n` is equal to 0, in which case it returns a list of 0 and 1. If `n` is not equal to 0, the function uses a let expression to create variables for the previous two numbers in the sequence (`a` and `b`), and then concatenates them to create the result. It then calls itself recursively with `n-1` as the input.\n\nAs in the previous example, the function uses the `conj` function to add items to the result list, and the `recur` function to perform the recursion.\n\nYou can also use the lazy-sequence library to compute the fibonacci sequence in a more idiomatic way in clojure\n```\n(require '[lazy-sequence :as ls]\n         '[clojure.walk :as walk])\n\n(defn fibonacci [n]\n  (ls/flow (iter (fn [a b] (cons a b))\n                (fn [a b] (map #(conj %) (cons a b)))\n                (fn [a b] (filter #(< %) a) (negate a)))\n            (iter", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715265312.0808797, "last_token_time": 1715265506.6213877, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715265312.099951, "cpu_loading_time": 1715265312.101712, "gpu_loading_time": 1715265312.101722, "first_token_time": 1715265312.8302143, "time_in_queue": 0.019071340560913086, "finished_time": 1715265506.621381}]}, "end_at": 8492936.547885686, "start_at": 8492590.094910443}

In some cases, content posted on social media can be harmful, hateful, or misleading, leading to real-world harm and harm to communities. By censoring certain types of content, social media platforms can help to create a safer and more inclusive online environment for users.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\nSocial media platforms provide a necessary and important space for free speech and expression. Censoring certain types of content, even if it is harmful or offensive, can be seen as an infringement on this right. Additionally, the censorship policies of social media platforms can be inconsistent and subject to bias, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability. Furthermore, censoring content can also stifle dialogue and obscure important perspectives that may be necessary for societal change. In some cases, the harm caused by social media platforms can be mitigated through other means such as increasing transparency and accountability or promoting media literacy. Restricting free speech and expression should be a measure of last resort, not a first response.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a complex issue and that different approaches and policies may be necessary depending on the specific context, goals and values of the stakeholders involved. The debate around social media censorship is likely to continue, and the optimal solution will likely depend on the specific circumstances.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that this are different type of social media censorship, like government censorship, self-censorship, community moderation and moderation by social media platforms. Each type have different implications and considerations.\n\nIn conclusion, The decision of whether or not to censor content on social media platforms is a complex and difficult one, and it's ultimately up to the platform and the society", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 436}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715265317.576016, "last_token_time": 1715265515.7693322, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715265317.5920932, "cpu_loading_time": 1715265317.5940435, "gpu_loading_time": 1715265317.5940576, "first_token_time": 1715265318.258091, "time_in_queue": 0.016077280044555664, "finished_time": 1715265515.7693267}]}, "end_at": 8492945.694711003, "start_at": 8492605.696632503}

This is because the number of operations required for the attention operator increases quadratically with the length of the sequence.\n\nTo address this issue, researchers have proposed a new method called Hyena, which is a subquadratic drop-in replacement for the attention operator.
