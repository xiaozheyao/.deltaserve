It's a fundamental theory that helps us understand the nature of reality and how the universe works.\n\nIn classical physics, objects have definite positions and velocities, and their behavior can be predicted with certainty. However, at the quantum level, things get a bit weird. Particles can exist in multiple places at the same time, and their behavior is governed by probabilities rather than definite outcomes. This is known as superposition.\n\nAnother strange aspect of quantum mechanics is entanglement. When two particles are entangled, their properties become linked, and what happens to one particle affects the other, even if they're separated by vast distances.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concept of wave-particle duality. Particles, such as electrons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they're observed. This is demonstrated by the double-slit experiment, where electrons passing through two slits create an interference pattern on a screen, indicating wave-like behavior. However, when observed individually, the electrons behave like particles.\n\nOne of the most famous equations in quantum mechanics is the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1714930999.8981352, "last_token_time": 1714931483.009233, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1714930999.978385, "cpu_loading_time": 1714930999.9824612, "gpu_loading_time": 1714930999.9824848, "first_token_time": 1714931029.5469835, "time_in_queue": 0.08024978637695312, "finished_time": 1714931483.009221}]}, "end_at": 19741353.93982614, "start_at": 19740530.57665725}
