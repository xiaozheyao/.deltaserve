If you have a CPU, you can use the multi-threading feature to run multiple threads simultaneously. If you have a GPU, you can use CUDA or PyTorch Lightning to add more GPUs to the model.\n2. Define a way to split data: To parallelize the neural network, you need to split the data into smaller chunks. You can use different techniques to do this. For example, you can use random sampling or stratified sampling to split the data.\n3. Divide parameters: Once you have split the data, you need to decide how to split the parameters of the model. One common approach is to use a one-to-one mapping between the data and the parameters. This means that if you have 1000 data points, you have 1000 parameters.\n4.

This will make the arena more interesting and engaging.\n4. Create challenges or tasks: Design challenges or tasks that are suitable for the chatbots. You can ask the chatbots to solve math problems, answer trivia questions, or engage in a conversation on a particular topic.\n5.
