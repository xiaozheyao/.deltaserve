Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale. At this scale, the normal rules of classical physics do not apply, and strange, seemingly random phenomena can occur.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum mechanics is superposition, which means that a particle can exist in multiple states at the same time. For example, a quantum bit, or qubit, can be both a 0 and a 1 simultaneously. This might seem strange, but it is a fundamental aspect of the quantum world.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is entanglement, which occurs when two or more particles become connected in such a way that they can instantaneously affect each other no matter how far apart they are. This means that the state of one particle can instantly affect the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the idea of probabilistic nature of quantum systems, This means that one cannot know the exact position and momentum of a particle at the same time. This phenomenon is described by the wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the conditions of the experiment.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concept of superposition and entanglement which allow for the possibility of", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1714381874.670966, "last_token_time": 1714381887.8127306, "first_scheduled_time": 1714381882.3864365, "cpu_loading_time": null, "gpu_loading_time": 1714381882.377621, "first_token_time": 1714381882.4245703, "time_in_queue": 7.715470552444458, "finished_time": 1714381887.812704}]}, "time_elapsed": 124.42734219878912, "relative_start_at": 39.404741019010544}

Please re-check your question and confirm the details.

If the altitude is not divided equally, then the lengths of the segments will not be in the ratio 1 : 2, and the method will not work.
