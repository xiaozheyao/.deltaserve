It describes the motion of subatomic particles, such as atoms and electrons, and the interactions between those particles.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is that particles can exist in multiple states or locations at the same time, known as superposition. This means that an atom, for example, can be in multiple positions simultaneously. Quantum mechanics also describes the possibility of particles being entangled with each other, meaning that the state of one particle affects the state of another, even if they are far apart.\n\nQuantum mechanics is also based on the idea that particles obey wave-particle duality, which means that they can display both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the circumstances. This allows for phenomena such as the diffraction of subatomic particles through matter, which was predicted by quantum mechanics and observed experimentally.\n\nThe principles of quantum mechanics are derived from a set of mathematical equations known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which governs the behavior of particles in a given system.

In a right-angled triangle, the altitude is connected to the hypotenuse and divides it into two segments. We can use this to our advantage to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nWe know that the altitude is 6 cm long, and we can divide this into the two segments formed by the hypotenuse. Since the altitude is vertical, it divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 triangles (each side forming a 30-60-90 triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse).\n\nIn each of the two 30-60-90 triangles, the shortest side is the altitude (6 cm), and the middle side is 30 cm. We can find the length of the hypotenuse by adding the length of the short side (6 cm) to the square root of the sum of the lengths of the middle and long sides (30 cm), since the 30-60-90 triangles are similar:\n\n6 cm + \u221a(30 cm\u00b2 + 120 cm\u00b2) = 30 cm\n\nCalculating the square root:\n\n\u221a(30 cm\u00b2 + 120 cm\u00b2) = \u221a(3000 cm\u00b2) = 1200 cm = 12 m\n\nSo, the hypotenuse is 12 m long.
