Data Parallelism:\nData parallelism involves distributing the computation across multiple processing units, each of which computes a subset of the total inference.

This technique is effective for models with a large number of parameters and amenable to scalarization.\n2. Model Parallelism:\nModel parallelism involves dividing the architecture of the neural network into smaller sub-models that can be processed independently on different GPUs. Each sub-model processes a subset of the input data and communicates with other sub-models to exchange information.\n3.

It explains how particles like atoms and subatomic particles like electrons and quarks behave in terms of probabilities and wave-like properties. The key idea in quantum mechanics is that these particles do not have a definite position or momentum until they are observed or measured, and that their behavior can be described by mathematical equations that relate the wave-like properties of particles to their probability distribution in space and time. This theory has been successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena from the structure of atoms to the behavior of materials at the nanoscale. However, it also introduces some strange and counterintuitive concepts, such as the idea that particles can exist in multiple locations at the same time, and that their behavior can be influenced by the act of observation. The precise meaning and implications of these concepts are still a subject of ongoing research and debate within the scientific community.

Eat a healthy diet: A diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can provide the nutrients your brain needs to function well.\n4. Exercise regularly: Exercise can improve blood flow to the brain and reduce stress, which can enhance your ability to concentrate.\n5. Break tasks into smaller steps: Sometimes the task at hand can feel overwhelming, which can lead to difficulty concentrating.

Here's one way to implement a function that lazily computes a Fibonacci sequence in Clojure:\n```\n(defn fibonacci [n]\n  (if (= n 0)\n    0\n    (if (= n 1)\n      1\n    (let [f (fibonacci (- n 1))\n          a (fibonacci (- n 2))]\n          (cons f a))))\n```\nThis function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. It uses a recursive approach, where each call to the function `fibonacci` is either the base case (when `n` is 0 or 1), or it calls itself twice (once with `n-1` and once with `n-2`) to compute the next two terms in the sequence.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\n(fibonacci 10)\n;;=> 55\n```\nThis would compute the 10th Fibonacci number, which is 55. As you can see, the function returns the result immediately, rather than computing the entire Fibonacci sequence lazily. If you wanted to compute the entire sequence lazily, you would need to use a different approach, such as generating each number in the sequence one by one and storing them in a vector or list.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n```\n\nWhat is a recursive function in Clojure?\n\nA recursive function is a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly, as a means of solving a problem.
