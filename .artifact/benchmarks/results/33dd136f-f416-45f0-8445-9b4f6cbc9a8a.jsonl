Additionally, you should consider things such as the number of chatbots you plan to support, the scope of interaction (e.g. whether they will be local or global, or whether they will involve multiple organizations), the form of interaction (MSR vs Text Chat vs Voice Chat, etc.), what sort of data privacy safeguards you will need, etc. Once you have an idea of what you want the arena to do, you can then begin to select appropriate tools, frameworks, and platforms to achieve your goal.

Here, we will discuss the architecture of an arena for chatbots in more detail.\nInterface for an Arena for Chatbots\nThe interface of an arena for chatbots consists of two main parts, the messaging interface and the response interface.
