The `fibonacci` function takes a positive integer `n` as an argument, and returns a lazy sequence of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. The `lazy-seq` form returns a sequence that is generated on the fly, rather than being constructed upfront.\n\nThe `fibonacci` function returns a cons cell containing the next Fibonacci number and the sequence of the previous numbers. If the `n`th Fibonacci number is 0, the sequence will be empty. The first few outputs of the `fibonacci` function are:\n\n* `fibonacci 10` returns `'(10 5 8 13 21 34 55)`.\n* `fibonacci 5` returns `'(5 8 13 21)`.\n* `fibonacci 3` returns `'(3 5 8)`.\n\nThis lazy approach allows the computation of the Fibonacci sequence to be deferred until it is needed, which can be beneficial in situations where memory usage is a concern. The sequence can be lazily evaluated by calling `seq` on the result of `fibonacci`, or by using a loop to consume the cells of the sequence one by one.

Protection of minors: Social media platforms have a responsibility to protect minors from harmful and explicit content. By censoring such content, they can eliminate the risk of minors accessing it.\n2. Protection of vulnerable groups: Social media platforms must ensure that vulnerable groups such as survivors of sexual assault or harassment are not exposed to harmful content or harassment. Censorship can help in creating a safer space for them.\n3. Prevention of cyberbullying: Social media censorship can help in preventing cyberbullying by eliminating hate speech or abusive language. It can create a positive and inclusive environment where everyone can feel safe.\n4. Protection of national security: In some cases, social media censorship may be necessary to protect national security or prevent the spread of misinformation that could harm public safety.\n\nArguments against social media censorship:\n\n1. Free speech concerns: Censorship can violate the right to free speech and expression. It can be seen as a restriction on the freedom of individuals to express their views and ideas.\n2. Censorship can be arbitrary: Censorship decisions can be arbitrary and capricious, and the decision makers can have a bias or a political agenda. This can lead to censorship of content that should not be censored and the suppression of legitimate voices.\n3. Limited effectiveness: Censorship may not be an effective solution to the problem it aims to address. It may be easily bypassed, and the content can continue to circulate on the platform.\n4. Limited resources: Social media companies have limited resources to monitor and enforce censorship. This can lead to inconsistencies in censorship decisions and the creation of a double standard.\n\nIn conclusion, social media censorship is not a simple issue, and there are valid arguments on both sides.

The length of the altitude is 6 cm, which means that the side opposite to the altitude is half of the hypotenuse. Also, note that there are different ways to skin this cat. For example, we could have used sine or cosine to find the length of the hypotenuse, instead of the Pythagorean theorem. But the key is to label the sides of the triangle and use the given information to set up the appropriate equation. I just happened to use the Pythagorean theorem this time.

This can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when using large models and datasets. PEFT aims to address this issue by partially freezing the model weights during fine-tuning, thus using fewer parameters to optimize the model.\n\nPEFT can be implemented in several ways, such as freezing a subset of layers, or freezing a specific set of learnable parameters in the model.
