If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is an even number, the function returns 1. If `n` is an odd number, the function returns the sum of the `n`th and `(n+1)`th Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThis is a \"lazy\" implementation in the sense that the computation of the actual Fibonacci numbers is deferred until the first time `my-fib` is called with an argument greater than or equal to 1. When this occurs, the function will compute and return the Fibonacci number for that argument value. Subsequent calls to `my-fib` with the same argument value will simply return the previously computed Fibonacci number, without recomputing it.\n\nIn practice, this might be useful if you needed to compute the Fibonacci numbers for a large range of values, but only wanted to perform the actual computation for a small subset of those values. For example, if you were implementing a program that was only interested in computing the 20th Fibonacci number, and nothing else, you might use `my-fib` to achieve this.

This approach is called a \"sequence-level\" approach. However, LoRA adopts a new \"linguistic-level\" approach, which processes the input sequence in smaller segments: chunks or slices, also known as \"sequence hops.\" This approach reduces the computational complexity of the large language model because it processes the input sequence in smaller parts, instead of sequentially. It is similar to the way humans process language, but in a computational manner.\n\nThe LoRA method is based on the Low-Rank Approximation (LRA) algorithm, which aims to approximate a high-dimensional tensor by a lower-dimensional tensor.
