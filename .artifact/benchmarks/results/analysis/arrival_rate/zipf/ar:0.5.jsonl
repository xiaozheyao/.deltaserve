It is a largely mathematical field that explains the abstract concepts of quantum theory, which describe the wave-like properties of particles and the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena.\n\nQuantum mechanics can be considered to be a special relativistic extension of classical mechanics. By comparing mechanics and quantum mechanics, they are similar in certain ways, but they also exhibit significant differences. In classical mechanics, objects move deterministically based on the forces acting on them. In quantum mechanics, particles behave in a stochastic and probabilistic way, with their position and momentum being described by a wave function.\n\nQuantum mechanics has been very successful in predicting many phenomena in physics, including the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles, the spectrum of light emitted by atoms, and the properties of solids and liquids. In addition, it has provided valuable insights into the nature of reality, including the question of whether particles exist as discrete entities or as probabilistic wave functions.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a complex field that requires a solid understanding of mathematics and physics.
