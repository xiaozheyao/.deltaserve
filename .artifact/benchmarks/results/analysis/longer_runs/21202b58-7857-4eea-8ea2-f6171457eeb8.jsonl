Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. At this scale, the normal rules of classical physics don't apply and strange, seemingly random phenomena can occur.\n\nOne key concept in quantum mechanics is that of superposition. This means that a quantum system, like an electron, can exist in multiple states at the same time. For example, an electron can be \"in\" the first energy level of an atom, or it can be \"in\" the second energy level, or it can be a combination of the two.\n\nAnother important concept is entanglement. This means that two or more quantum systems can be so strongly connected that the state of one system is dependent on the state of the other. For example, two particles that were created at the same time and were in contact with each other can become \"entangled\", so that you cannot describe the state of one particle without knowing the state of the other.\n\nQuantum mechanics also describes how particles can exhibit wave-like behavior, and how they can collide and interact.\n\nIt's important to note that these concepts are mathematical in nature, and are often represented using complex mathematical functions.

To do this, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n12/c = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for c:\n12c = 12\nc = 1\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is 1 cm. Is there anything else I can help with?\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. \n\nCheers! \n\n\ubc88\uc5ed\uacb0\uacfc  \n\uc81c\uacf5\ub41c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uada4\uc810(h), \uae4a\uc774(c)\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc774 1:2\uc774\uba70 \uada4\uc810\uc758 \uae38\uc774\uac00 6cm\uc778 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc591\ubcc0 \ubc1c\uad74\uc758 \ubc00\ub3c4\ub77c\uace0 \uac00\uc815\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub2e4\uc74c\uc744 \ucc44\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\nh/c = 1/2\n\uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uada4\uc810\uc758 \uae38\uc774\ub97c 6cm\ub85c \ub300\uccb4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n6/c = 1/2\n\uc774\uc81c \uc8fc\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uac12\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec c, \uae4a\uc774\uc758 \uae38\uc774\ub97c \ucc3e\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub450 \ubc88 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ubaab\uc73c\ub85c ", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 60, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens": 498}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1717954711.8294303, "last_token_time": 1717955093.2759953, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1717955031.1590064, "cpu_loading_time": 1717955045.3330204, "gpu_loading_time": 1717955048.1408627, "first_token_time": 1717955048.2940664, "time_in_queue": 319.3295760154724, "finished_time": 1717955093.2759912}]}, "end_at": 11182523.19678686, "start_at": 11182141.742933853}

However, this complexity comes at a cost, including longer training times and higher computational requirements.\n\nLoRA addresses these challenges by reducing the model's rank, i.e., the number of layers and hidden units.

LoRA achieves this reduction in rank while preserving the quality of the model's outputs by using a low-rank approximation technique that maintains the essential structure of the original model while removing redundancies.\n\nIn summary, LoRA is a method for adapting large language models by reducing their complexity, improving their efficiency, and maintaining their effectiveness, making it easier and more cost-effective to deploy and train these models", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 284, "completion_tokens": 242}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1717954792.7345526, "last_token_time": 1717955131.5972676, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1717955093.2767973, "cpu_loading_time": 1717955100.2409537, "gpu_loading_time": 1717955100.93376, "first_token_time": 1717955104.9942997, "time_in_queue": 300.54224467277527, "finished_time": 1717955131.5972624}]}, "end_at": 11182561.517679052, "start_at": 11182222.648979556}
