In this case, we know that the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1:2, so we can assume that the other two sides are equal in length to the altitude.\n\nLet x be the length of the altitude (the side opposite the right angle), and let y be the length of the side adjacent to the right angle. Then we have:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = (2/3)^2 \\* x^2\n\nwhere (2/3)^2 = 4/9, so x^2 = 4/9.\n\nWe want to solve for x^2, so let's square both sides of the equation:\n\n(x^2 + y^2) \\* (4/9) = x^4\n7x^2 + (3/2)y^2 = x^4\n\nNext, let's multiply both sides by 21 to get rid of the fraction on the left side:\n\n14x^2 + 3y^2 = 2x^4\n7x^2 - 3y^2 = x^4\n\nSince x^2 is equal to 4/9, we can substitute that into the left side of the equation above:\n\n7x^2 - 3y^2 = 4/9^2\n\nNow let's multiply both sides by 36 to get rid of the square root:\n\n21x^2 - 9y^2 = 144/81\n\nFinally, we can solve for x by subtracting 21x^2 from both sides:\n\nx^2 - 21x^2 = 144/81 - 9y^2\n-1x^2 = -57/81 + 9y^2\n\nNow we can solve for x.
