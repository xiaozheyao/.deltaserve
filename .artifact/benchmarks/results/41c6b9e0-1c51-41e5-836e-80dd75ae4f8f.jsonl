The authors want to find out what kind of architectures and pretraining objectives are best for zero-shot generalization. They test three types of architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with two different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. They trained models with over 5 billion parameters and evaluated their results. They found that the strongest zero-shot generalization occurred in the causal decoder-only model trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective, but other models with different architectures and objectives also performed well after finetuning. The authors conclude by suggesting that pretrained models can be adapted to be performant generative models. In other words, the study found that different pretraining architectures and objectives can be combined to achieve better zero-shot generalization results.

LoRA stands for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models, which is a new approach that has been developed by researchers at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) to improve the efficiency and performance of language models.\n\nIn contrast to traditional language models that have a fixed architecture (such as transformer-based models like BERT and GPT), LoRA allows for models with dynamic architectures. This means that the number of layers and the size of the model can be adjusted on the fly during inference to achieve optimal performance, while also reducing memory and inference time.\n\nLoRA does this by using a technique called matrix factorization, which allows the model to represent a large size n x m matrix using a lower-rank n x k matrix, where k is much smaller than m. This allows for more efficient computation, as well as faster inference times, as the size of the model does not increase while it is being trained.\n\nIn summary, LoRA is a new approach for improving the performance and efficiency of language models by allowing for dynamic architectures and using matrix factorization to reduce computational complexity.\n\nI hope this helps", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 42, "total_tokens": 284, "completion_tokens": 242}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1713267306.7337139, "last_token_time": 1713267925.596062, "first_scheduled_time": 1713267857.6185617, "cpu_loading_time": 1713267876.0462904, "gpu_loading_time": 1713267876.396266, "first_token_time": 1713267877.163711, "time_in_queue": 550.8848478794098, "finished_time": 1713267925.5960536}]}, "time_elapsed": 618.868954045698, "relative_start_at": 19.50208537466824}
