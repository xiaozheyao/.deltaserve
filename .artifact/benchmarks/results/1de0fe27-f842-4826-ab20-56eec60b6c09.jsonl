Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to warm up the engine and circulate the oil.\n6. Check the oil level using the dipstick and add more oil if necessary.\n7. Save the used oil and filter for recycling.\n\nIt is recommended to consult the owner's manual of your specific Porsche 911 model for detailed instructions and specifications.

To install these packages, run the following command:\n```\nnpm install express react react-dom bootstrap typescript @types/express @types/react @types/react-dom --save-dev\n```\nThis will install the necessary packages and create a TypeScript declaration file for ExpressJS and ReactJS.\n\nNow, let's create a basic ExpressJS server that serves our ReactJS app. Create a new file called `server.ts` in your project folder and add the following code:\n```typescript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.static('build'));\n\napp.get('*', (req, res) => {\n  const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);\n  res.send(`\n    <html>\n      <head>\n        <title>My ReactJS App</title>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">${html}</div>\n        <script src=\"static/build/main.js\"></script>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  `);\n});\n\napp.listen(300", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens": 401}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715367655.6558275, "last_token_time": 1715368493.826553, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715368114.3623796, "cpu_loading_time": 1715368138.7837856, "gpu_loading_time": 1715368138.887819, "first_token_time": 1715368203.6074147, "time_in_queue": 458.706552028656, "finished_time": 1715368493.82654}]}, "end_at": 8595923.748920118, "start_at": 8595085.570196377}

They are also studied to understand the evolution of galaxies and the fate of massive stars.\n\nIn addition, supernovae have also been used as a source of energy in some science fiction books and movies, such as Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"The Changeling\", where the USS Enterprise uses the power of a supernova to propel itself out of a black hole.

One of the key components of Transformers is the attention operator, which allows the model to selectively focus on certain parts of the input sequence when making predictions. However, the attention operator has a quadratic cost in the sequence length, which limits the amount of context that can be accessed.\n\nExisting methods that aim to reduce the computational costs of attention operators rely on low-rank and sparse approximations, but these approaches still need to be combined with dense attention layers to match the performance of Transformers. This indicates a gap in capability between existing subquadratic methods and Transformers.\n\nThe proposed Hyena attention mechanism works by interleaving long convolutions and data-controlled gating. This allows Hyena to perform attention operations in a subquadratic manner, meaning that the cost of the attention operation is not proportional to the sequence length.
