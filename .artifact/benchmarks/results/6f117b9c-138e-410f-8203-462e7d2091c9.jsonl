At this scale, the classicalrules of physics, such as the laws of motion and electromagnetism, do not apply and the behavior is governed by the probabilities of quantum states. It is based on a few key principles, such as the uncertainty principle and the wave-particle duality, and has been experimentally verified in numerous experiments. In simple terms, at the quantum level, particles can exist in multiple states at once and their behavior can be described by the superposition of these states and the interaction with the environment. The probabilities of these states change with the observation of the particle, a phenomenon known as wavefunction collapse. The uncertainty principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain physical quantities, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. The wave-particle duality states that particles behave as both waves and particles depending on the scale and the observation method. It is a complex and counterintuitive theory, but it is the foundation of modern physics and has far reaching implications on our understanding of the universe.
