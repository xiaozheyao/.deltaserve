However, in quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and their position and momentum are uncertain. The uncertainty principle states that the more precisely you know a particle's position, the less precisely you can know its momentum, and vice versa. This implies that particles can be in multiple states at the same time, meaning that they can be in multiple places at once, which is not possible in classical physics.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concepts of superposition and entanglement. A particle in a superposition is in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become connected so that the state of one particle affects the state of the other, even if they are separated by very large distances.\n\nThese ideas are counterintuitive and require a different way of thinking about matter and energy.
