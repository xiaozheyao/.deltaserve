Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It is based on the idea that the properties of particles at this scale are governed by probabilities rather than definite values, and that these particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit the properties of both waves and particles at different times. This is demonstrated in the famous double-slit experiment, where particles pass through two slits and create an interference pattern on a screen behind them. The particles behave like waves, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots on the screen, but if we observe the particles individually, they act like particles, creating separate spots.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is superposition, which means that particles can exist in more than one state at the same time. For example, a particle can be in two places at once, or it can be spinning up or spinning down.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts that particles can become entangled, meaning that their properties become linked in such a way that the state of one particle can affect the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances.\n\nQuantum mechanics has had a profound influence on many areas of science, from", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715460816.2926292, "last_token_time": 1715460937.8186843, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715460846.4148872, "cpu_loading_time": 1715460846.4175858, "gpu_loading_time": 1715460846.4622765, "first_token_time": 1715460846.7564094, "time_in_queue": 30.122257947921753, "finished_time": 1715460937.818668}]}, "end_at": 8688367.74188913, "start_at": 8688240.31123717}
