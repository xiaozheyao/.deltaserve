Algorithmic parallelism: This technique involves optimizing the neural network's architecture and optimization algorithms to better exploit parallelism. For example, layer-wise parallelism can be achieved by parallelizing the forward and backward passes for each layer, or batch normalization can be parallelized by calculating the running statistics for each device.\n4.

It describes the behavior of particles that are much smaller than atoms, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, and the forces that govern their interactions. Quantum mechanics is based on the hypothesis that the behavior of particles is governed by probabilities rather than definite positions and velocities. This is in contrast to classical mechanics, which describes the behavior of larger objects and is based on the idea that particles have definite positions and velocities.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the exact position and velocity of a particle with complete certainty. Instead, we can only know the probability of finding a particle at a particular location and velocity. This means that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and that their behavior is influenced by the act of measurement.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit properties of both waves and particles depending on the context. For example, electrons can behave like waves when they pass through a double slit, but they can also behave like particles when they collide with a nucleus.\n\nQuantum mechanics has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe, and has led to the development of new technologies", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715454732.9589472, "last_token_time": 1715454918.8507361, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715454875.528392, "cpu_loading_time": 1715454875.5307832, "gpu_loading_time": 1715454875.572031, "first_token_time": 1715454875.9036224, "time_in_queue": 142.56944489479065, "finished_time": 1715454918.8507288}]}, "end_at": 8682348.774038238, "start_at": 8682162.871938966}
