This interruption is caused by a groove in the brain called the hippocampal fissure.

The temporal lobe is also supporting the mind in numerous functions related to spatial relationships, abstract thought, and perceptual awareness. Subsequently, this is one of the lobes more commonly affected when someone suffers from schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders.\nA superior temporal sulcus (STS) is the lateral sulcus, the sulcus between the middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus, and posterior to the middle temporal gyrus. Both temporal gyri are in the inferior temporal gyrus which is a part of temporal lobe of the cerebrum in the primeval neurological system. The temporal gyri is the most regular convolution of the cerebral cortex and it wraps around its internal surface with a sort of accordion arrangement.
