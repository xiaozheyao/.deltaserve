Trying to get a better balance of introspective scenes/dialogue versus action. I'm getting worried I'm going to have too much action in there, but otoh when have I ever worried about that in any way? The only thing I think I'd worry about is slowing the main plot down by trying to pack too much action in. But that won't be a problem if I cut down some of the other stuff. :3\n2) 80,000-some words done, total's between 95k-100k, which is almost certainly not going to end well, vertically.\n3) I've got a climactic action sequence for the end of Act Three worked out, everything else is still kind of up in the air. I'm writing more \"stuff\" around those scenes, but with regards to the actual tactics of the battle, I mean, not anything I can't just rework at the last second.\n4) Hmm. Action sequences. I should maybe do another one this week? I should maybe think up some interesting things for my assistants to do? Well, Naomi definitely has stuff. The more useful though, the better. Burgstrom isn't a useful fighter at all, but she knows spellcraft like no one else, and can do solarian wireless just as well as anyone else. I'll keep thinking about people in terms of useful fighters.\n5) My last Burning Ones story didn't do much for me in terms of like, concept races I wanted to write up characters for. This one's doing much better. Maybe because I've only done it like once so it still feels somewhat interesting, but the ostrich people are pretty neat. This'll be the first time I've done a story for a Burning Ones race that's not even really part of a human society to begin with. Gotta keep putting them out there.\n6) I never did notice the Artificer having any particular role in one of my old Next Yuki drafts, so I figured I should just add them to the settings so they exist.\n7) Taking some of the extra special (i.e. impractical or weird) houses in Flesh Nest and using the same ideals for edifices in Erubesu so they can be used over there.

There is no need to synchronize or wait on each other. In fact, all these assistants run in different processes, and therefore, do not even directly communicate with each other. Note that each assistant waits for incoming data, then \u201ceats\u201d the data and ignores what other helper does. We can use a fancy diagram to present the results. In the image below, the yellow arrows represent the data exchange among these helpers, and the green arrows denote the waiting state, while the helping process only becomes \u201cactive\u201d when it waits to process data.\nTight Coupling: Social Networking API\nIn theory, the programmer should simply build the app and let the network do the rest. In practice, what often happens is that the code and the network become tightly coupled. Consider the Simple API for Social Media (SASM) code and the Facebook API. SASM is a set of library functions simplifying the use of various popular online services. It consists of two parts, one uses the Facebook Graph API, while the other leverages the Twitter API to perform operations using OAuth (such as authentication and authorization).\nNote that the SASM code is still closely coupled with the network code and requires a considerable amount of manual code. So it is still not useful for programmers who are mostly clueless about the APIs and the concepts that are still difficult to grasp for newbie programmers.

Pansharpening is a high-resolution technique, which combines the spectral detail from a multi-spectral image with the spatial detail from a panchromatic image. This technique is done through the data calibration algorithms of ASTER. A multi-spectral image is composed of different channels allowing us to see the reflectance of the Earth with different spectral properties within each channel. Whereas the panchromatic image shows the strength of the radiance within the optical and near infrared range. Therefore, a high resolution pansharpened product can be processed from either multiple bands within the spectral difference, such as the pansharpening between bands 3,4 of NIR+SWIR, or the entire ADBERTiS product where only the panchromatic dataset is used to produce the high resolution pansharpened product.\nLaitan, C.N., Moore, D.G.

Boo!\nACTUAL: Integrate the right side of the natural logarithm function.\nREVISED: Integrate the inverse function of exp\nWARNING: Probability distributions involving squares or roots are often non-gaussian and are best fit with tools other than the Gaussian distribution. As a result, statisticians prefer to focus on other statistical models.\nDEFINITION: A distribution that takes a value from a continuous set and exposes it to a random variable that is included with weights that sum up to 1. This occurs along a distribution curve that indicates the outcome of a quantitative variable as a numerical entity. This is relevant in distribution theory, where the probability density of a continuous variable has a dimension of 1 per unit of area.\nSTATISTICAL MEANING: Statistical distributions are used to model uncertainty, and in particular, probability distributions. In probability theory, discrete and continuous variables are modeled as random variables to create probability distributions. The probability density or mass function is a unique continuous function that denotes the relative chance of finding its inputs in a given area of the input variable. Mathematically, CPDs can also assign probabilities of different outcomes to different contiguous regions of its input variable. This distribution is called the Dirac delta function or comb distribution.\nSTATISTICAL FUNCTIONS: The logistic distribution is known by its equation y=e-xy=e-x. This function is symmetrical and positive which includes a mean of x. Furthermore, it has an infinite variance and a standard deviation of 1/x. This distribution can be constructed using the Normal approximation.\nNAMED AFTER: The name \u2018Bernoulli\u2019 is used to refer to both the discrete probability distribution that contains Bernoulli trials and the contraction function that holds the binomial distribution.\nINDEPENDENT EVENTS: Probability distributions are used to model scientific phenomena based on previous history and knowledge. They can also include random variables, in which case they are not independent but are correlated.\nEQUATIONS: There are many probability distributions that are used in statistics, and these distributions include transformations of", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens": 459}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715492700.999188, "last_token_time": 1715493566.7619376, "start_loading_time": 1715493385.1877754, "first_scheduled_time": 1715493389.91362, "cpu_loading_time": null, "gpu_loading_time": 1715493389.9084313, "first_token_time": 1715493389.9611433, "time_in_queue": 688.9144320487976, "finished_time": 1715493566.761833}]}, "end_at": 20303433.740265016, "start_at": 20302567.63558286}

It is a scripting language that is inserted into HTML pages, and it is also used to build mobile and desktop apps as well. It has been around for almost 25 years so it\u2019s known and fairly understood by many developers. JavaScript is interpreted by a program called the JavaScript engine, which converts JavaScript code into machine-level code that is executed on the web browser.\nTypescript on the other hand is a syntactic superset of JavaScript. It has additional features that extend JavaScript\u2019s syntax. Typescript provides access to type information, error checking, and (limited) type inference at compile time. It also integrates nicely with Angular, React, and many other libraries and frameworks. Typescript is a typed language, which means that every variable, function, and class must be declared with a specific type. This helps reduce errors and improve code quality. Typescript supports the same JavaScript syntax as the open web, however its compilers ensure that all code meets a very specific structure known as type definitions which give additional flexibility and assurance for developer applications.\nTypescript has been steadily gaining popularity in recent years due to its ability to provide modern development capabilities while still being backward compatible with JavaScript. Overall, it\u2019s a language with a bright future.\nAvery Jonathan\nProcess Enthusiast\nUser asks: What is the main difference between JavaScript", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens": 315}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715492705.9515288, "last_token_time": 1715493728.6401393, "start_loading_time": 1715493561.9265342, "first_scheduled_time": 1715493566.6769388, "cpu_loading_time": null, "gpu_loading_time": 1715493566.6709461, "first_token_time": 1715493566.7220259, "time_in_queue": 860.7254099845886, "finished_time": 1715493728.6400988}]}, "end_at": 20303595.617967915, "start_at": 20302570.93759445}
