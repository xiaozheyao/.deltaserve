The first, being alone, panicked every night at the thought of impending separation from the matrix. She worries and sleeps poorly, and wakes up or downs to the principal agent on earth, having exhaustened the characters he sees justice to the pueblo, to give her and nexus his worries and fears. But the world is coming to know us better than she knows herself, like the human who has as much attention and insight into the life of an elephant as the one who knows the life of an insect as well. All of us are creatures of knowledge, and all of us require the truth about the other in order to find common ground upon which to act. That is how societies are built and thrive. That is how we live. And for all that has ever known, we humans hold that knowledge in our hands. \n# [DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 2]\n1. Many fans seem overly focused on the defects of Joules' character. Do your opinions of the defects in his character differ (based on the quality of your alignments) between people and software agents (assistants/chatbots)?\n2. In Midway the humans and the nanobots end up together because they share common worries about their progress.
