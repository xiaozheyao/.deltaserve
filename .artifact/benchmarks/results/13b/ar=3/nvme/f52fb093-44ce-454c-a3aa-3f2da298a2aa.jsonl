This is demonstrated by the double-slit experiment, where electrons passing through two slits create an interference pattern on a screen, indicating a wave-like behavior, even though individual electrons can also be observed, showing particle-like behavior.\n\nAnother key principle of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of properties, such as position and momentum, cannot be known with absolute certainty at the same time. This is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nQuantum mechanics has been extremely successful in explaining numerous phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level.
