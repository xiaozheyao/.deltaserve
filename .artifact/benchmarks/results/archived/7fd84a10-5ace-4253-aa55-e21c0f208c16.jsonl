After pretraining, instead of fine-tuning the entire model for a specific task, LoRA only fine-tunes a low-rank approximation of the key weight matrix of the pretrained model. This reduced set of parameters can be trained much faster and with lower computational resources than the full model.\n\nThe low-rank approximation is calculated using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which factorizes the weight matrix into a product of a low-rank matrix and an orthogonal matrix.

To compute the value of the `n`-th number, this function uses a simple recursive approach, but it does so lazily, by memoizing the results of previous computations.\n\nIn particular, the `next` function is a recursive function that takes an integer `n`, an initial value `a`, and a function `f` that computes the `n+1`-th Fibonacci number. The `next` function uses this function `f` to compute the `n+1`-th Fibonacci number, but it always memoizes the result of the previous computation with the same arguments. Specifically, it associates the result of one computation with a map key on the threads of the function call stack, and later invocations of `next` with the same arguments will check whether the result has already been computed and memoize it for later use.\n\nNote that this implementation uses dynamic var scoping to memoize the results of previous computations. When calling the `next` function, it will use the current values of the `a`, `b`, and `next` variables on the thread to compute the result, and this result will be memoized with a map key that includes these variables.\n\nAlso note that the base cases of the recurisve function are `1` for the", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715277546.341872, "last_token_time": 1715278018.2124922, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715277546.392275, "cpu_loading_time": 1715277546.3977437, "gpu_loading_time": 1715277546.39776, "first_token_time": 1715277547.8769329, "time_in_queue": 0.05040311813354492, "finished_time": 1715278018.212487}]}, "end_at": 10495931.173199983, "start_at": 10495365.725589104}

Platforms have the right to regulate and censor content that they determine to be harmful or offensive.\n\nCensorship of hate speech,harassment, and misinformation can foster a safer and more inclusive online environment. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for platforms to censor false information that could lead to harm.\n\nHowever, it's important to strike a balance between censorship and free speech. Overly broad censorship can lead to the silencing of important voices and ideas. Additionally, censorship can be used as a tool for governments to suppress dissent and stifle criticism.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\nCensorship of social media content is a slippery slope that can lead to the suppression of important information and viewpoints. This can result in a lack of accountability for those in power and the silencing of marginalized voices.\n\nCensorship can also create a false sense of security, leading people to rely on platforms to monitor and regulate content. This can ultimately put the burden on platforms to make subjective judgments about what should and should not be allowed, rather than leaving it up to individuals to decide for themselves what they want to see and hear.\n\nFurthermore, social media platforms are an important tool for people to express themselves, organize and mobilize, and access information. Censorship can potentially hinder these activities and limit the ability of individuals to make informed decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, social media censorship can be necessary in certain circumstances, but it's important to carefully consider the potential consequences of such actions and apply them in a transparent and objective manner.

The attention operator assigns importance to different parts of a sequence when processing it, and is computationally expensive as the sequence length increases. This limits the amount of context that can be accessed by the model.\n\nTo address this issue, the authors propose a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention called Hyena. Hyena is constructed by interleaving long convolutions and data-controlled gating, which reduces the computational cost of the attention operator while maintaining its capability to learn complex patterns in the data.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods in tasks that involve recall and reasoning on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens. Additionally, Hyena matches the performance of attention-based models on standard datasets, such as WikiText103 and The Pile, while requiring 20% less training compute at sequence length 2K.\n\nHyena", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 535, "completion_tokens": 241}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715277553.2638566, "last_token_time": 1715278042.850831, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715277845.0495427, "cpu_loading_time": 1715277845.0530314, "gpu_loading_time": 1715277845.1817584, "first_token_time": 1715277846.773189, "time_in_queue": 291.78568601608276, "finished_time": 1715278042.850827}]}, "end_at": 10495955.810253076, "start_at": 10495378.627749061}

Supernovae play an important role in the cycle of element production and recycling in the universe, and their study can provide valuable insight into the life cycles of stars and the universe as a whole. They can also have a profound impact on the galaxies they occur in, by dispersing heavy elements and triggering the formation of new stars and planets. There are two main types of supernovae: Type Ia, which are caused by the collapse of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf in a binary system, and Type II, which are caused by the collapse of a massive star's core after it has exhausted its fuel. Both types of supernovae can be studied through a combination of telescopic observations and theoretical modeling, and they continue to be an active area of research in astrophysics.\n\n[Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova)\n[2](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/supernovae-cosmic-factories-for-building-heavy-elements)\n[3](https://www.livingstopics.org/supernova/)\n[4](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/collaboration/supernova/students/supernova_what", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens": 359}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715277557.0648186, "last_token_time": 1715278072.2848039, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715277845.0495427, "cpu_loading_time": 1715277845.0530298, "gpu_loading_time": 1715277845.1817553, "first_token_time": 1715277846.773189, "time_in_queue": 287.9847240447998, "finished_time": 1715278072.284795}]}, "end_at": 10495985.244561624, "start_at": 10495384.029162137}
