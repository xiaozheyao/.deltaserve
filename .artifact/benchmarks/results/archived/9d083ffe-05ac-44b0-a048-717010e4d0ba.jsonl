Since the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments, it is the halfway point between the two segments. This means that the two segments have a sum of length 6 cm.\n\nSince we know the ratio between the two segments, we can find the proportion between their lengths. Let's say that the shorter segment is x. Then, the longer segment is 2x. The sum of their lengths is 6 cm, so we can write:\n\nx + 2x = 6\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n3x = 6\n\nDividing by 3, we get:\n\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, the longer segment is 2x, which is 4 cm.
