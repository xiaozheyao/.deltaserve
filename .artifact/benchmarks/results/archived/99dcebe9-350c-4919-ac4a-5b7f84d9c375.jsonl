Retrieved 8 May 2008.\nNeed has been identified to develop Web tools to intelligently assist scientists, engineers and researchers to not only search databases of scientific and scholarly publications, but also to search institutional repositories with facts of their own work, and thereby, to remove the silos in communication between academics. This presents a real opportunity, and not just an educational challenge, to have a system that is beneficial for everyone, from students and trainees, to faculty and researchers. Ideally, such a system is one that has the ability to support a reconfigure model to display complex information in a complementary fashion for multiple purposes.\nOne way of defining this system is by creating a simplified computer-based replication of the way a human brain stores, retrieves, and organizes thoughts and knowledge. The \"human way\" to conduct research and publications is through thought, organization, evaluation, and by generation of thoughts, all as prioritized by the nature of the thought process itself. We often favor the input of a task to the intellect and efforts of evaluative problem solving. Research and publication is not different.\nThis article describes a technology of recent web literature searching applications that is not just identifying and dialoguing freely on words found in text but linking words and concepts using ideas and themes of the commonly understood concepts of the universe of human knowledge. This technology may one day emerge in a form that can compete with the human intelligence for scientific research, but it is a long way from doing that, as is evident from the performance of Socratic (4 January 2009) in querying the Internet.
