It is a fundamental theory that describes the properties of particles at those scales, and it has had a profound impact on many areas of science.\n\nIn classical physics, matter is described as a collection of particles that move in discrete, well-defined paths. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, describes matter as a wave-like entity that occupies a range of possible positions. This range is described by the wave function, which is a mathematical function that is used to calculate the probability of finding the particle at a particular position.\n\nOne of the most famous results of quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality. This refers to the fact that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. For example, electrons that are observed in a cloud chamber appear as wavy trails, but when they are passed through a fine mesh, they exhibit particle-like behavior by passing through the holes.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts the existence of properties such as entanglement, superposition, and tunneling. These properties are often counterintuitive and have been experimentally verified.\n\nIn summary, quantum mechanics is a powerful theory that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level.

It uses recursion to compute the sequence, lazily generating the remaining numbers as needed. The `next-fibs` function works the same way, but returns a list of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.\n\nTo use these functions, try something like this:\n```scss\n(next-fib 10)\n;; => 55\n\n(next-fibs 10)\n;; => [0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34]\n```\nNote that these functions are not optimized for performance, but they should be fast enough for small integers. For larger values of `n`, you may want to consider using a different approach, such as generating the Fibonacci sequence iteratively or using a table lookup.\n\nAlso, there is a flaw in the `next-fibs` function that can cause unexpected results for some inputs. Specifically, if `n` is equal to 1, the function will return `nil`, rather than `[0 1]`. To fix this, you can use a shorter loop like this:\n```ruby\n(defn next", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715268229.5180032, "last_token_time": 1715268388.7449794, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715268229.5450091, "cpu_loading_time": 1715268229.5550437, "gpu_loading_time": 1715268229.555065, "first_token_time": 1715268229.8816304, "time_in_queue": 0.027005910873413086, "finished_time": 1715268388.744963}]}, "end_at": 8495818.674529547, "start_at": 8495658.555768766}

Protection of minors: Social media platforms often contain explicit content that is not appropriate for minors. By censoring such content, platforms can protect the well-being of young users.\n2. Reduction of online harassment: Online harassment is a significant issue, with many people experiencing bullying, hate speech, and other forms of harmful behavior. Censorship can help reduce the spread of such content and make social media platforms safer.\n3. Combatting misinformation: Social media has been used to spread misinformation and disinformation, which can have real-world consequences. Censorship can help prevent the spread of false information and protect users from being misled.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\n1. First Amendment concerns: Censorship on social media platforms raises constitutional concerns related to free speech. The First Amendment protects the right to express oneself online, and censoring certain content could be viewed as a violation of this right.\n2. Uneven enforcement: Social media companies often struggle with uneven enforcement of their content moderation policies. This can lead to biased censorship, where certain groups are targeted more than others.\n3. Chilling effect on free expression: Censorship can create a chilling effect on free expression, as users may be less likely to share controversial or dissenting opinions out of fear of being censored. This could lead to a homogenization of ideas and suppress the diversity of viewpoints on social media platforms.\n\nIn summary, while there are valid arguments for social media censorship, questions about the constitutionality of such measures, inconsistent enforcement, and the potential chilling effect on free expression are also important considerations. Ultimately, the balance between protecting users and safeguarding free speech is a complex issue, and social media companies must navigate this carefully.\n\nSources:\n\n1. <https://www.politico.com", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 436}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715268245.4816387, "last_token_time": 1715268403.6795902, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715268245.4961336, "cpu_loading_time": 1715268245.4987426, "gpu_loading_time": 1715268245.4987524, "first_token_time": 1715268245.9770644, "time_in_queue": 0.014494895935058594, "finished_time": 1715268403.6795874}]}, "end_at": 8495833.60277381, "start_at": 8495674.158260033}

This technique was introduced by Ali Rahimi and Benjamin Recht in their paper \"Model Compression: Image Classification with Primal Sparse Convolutions and Compressed Neural Networks\" in 2017.\n\nThe core idea behind PEFT is to replace the dense layers of the model with sparse convolutional layers, which have a smaller number of learnable parameters. Sparse convolutions are convolutions with a small number of non-zero weights, resulting in a more efficient and structured representation of the input. This results in a closure property, where the output of the network can be computed from a subset of the input features, leading to more efficient inference.\n\nThe PEFT algorithm achieves parameter efficiency by replacing the dense layers of the network with sparse convolutional layers.
