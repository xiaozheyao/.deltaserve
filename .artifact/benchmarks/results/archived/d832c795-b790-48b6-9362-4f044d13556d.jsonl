Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, specifically the atomic and subatomic level. It is based on wave-particle duality, which suggests that particles such as electrons and photons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is superposition, which means that a particle can be in multiple states or locations at the same time. For example, an electron can be in both the ground state and the first excited state of an atom simultaneously.\n\nAnother key principle is uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical quantities, such as position and momentum, cannot be precisely determined simultaneously. This is because of the wave-like nature of particles, as the more accurately the position of a particle is determined, the less accurately its momentum can be determined, and vice versa.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concept of entanglement, which means that the properties of particles can become correlated even when they are separated by large distances. This can lead to phenomena such as quantum communication and quantum computers.\n\nThere are also principles such as wave-particle duality, which suggests that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a mathematical equation that describes the behavior of a", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1714323023.388579, "last_token_time": 1714323283.2573195, "first_scheduled_time": 1714323093.2628565, "cpu_loading_time": 1714323093.265916, "gpu_loading_time": 1714323093.2659361, "first_token_time": 1714323096.2484982, "time_in_queue": 69.87427759170532, "finished_time": 1714323283.2573109}]}, "time_elapsed": 259.9233703678474, "relative_start_at": 39.4048831560649}
