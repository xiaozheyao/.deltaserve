In this technique, high spatial-resolution (LR) data is combined with low spectral-resolution (HR) data to create a pansharpened image with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This technique is based on the assumption that there must be significant common information within LR and HR images, thus allowing for the fusion of these two images without compromising visual appearance. Applications include satellite data from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), a hyperspectral sensor with six visible, seven near-IR, and 19 thermal channels, to provide high spatial resolution multispectral imagery.\nUSER: Thank you, but I\u2019d rather see the results of pansharpening used on satellite image products from the Advanced Baseline Imager rather than a table of values.\nASSISTANT: OK.

The major problem is that Dialogflow can\u2019t figure out what you want unless it has an example of the entity format and multiple examples for larger, more complex queries.\nI don\u2019t think that this can readily be done with only 1 actor per intent and each intent being only matched to a single question. But assuming strict backwards compatibility, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see training be improved so we can match bot intent with real-world user questions.\nIt\u2019s pretty common that developers set up gchat rooms that they can use for consulting (example). A few months ago, I remembered how I used to use templates to create more interesting SSH paysage than bash% and I ended up combining that with some upcoming events to create #thinking in Sep 2006 which is hosted by pdc. The channel is private but I don\u2019t know the classmate I assigned the room to nor his screen name so it was easier to take a peek at the gadgets and figure out the room name and how to reach the bot.\nwhere \u201c<table name\u201d is simply a list between \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u201d. The format string allows you to always be abstracted away from needing to know what the table is in JSON or how to format the data.\nIf you use the templates feature, then you\u2019ll have a TPLTMPL object. I used to just append the templates\u2026 into a list and then print it with %repr but debugging 100 lines of templates leaves a lot to be desired. It does work if you break and you get similar outputs but that was one step too far. Instead, each template will have a row index value.

Now if the computer does figure out natural language processing, how it should reply in the context of the conversation, things like that, then calling it AI seems more reasonable.

But how does this help you determine the length of the hypotenuse?\nASSISTANT: You would use the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is equal to the square of the length of the third side, all lengths being measured in units of the same type.\nUS: The sum of 4.2 cm squared and 6 cm squared is 90.32 cm2. the side of 90.32 cm2 can be expressed as x cm2. Therefore x2 = 90.32 cm2. Getting the square root of both sides I get 90.32 = x, no wait 3 = x because 90.32 doesnt go into 3 cleanly. The length of the hypotonous is 3 cm\nASSISTANT: The side opposite the altitude is equal to the square root of 90.32. This is 3.\nUS: Then you multiply this by the opposite sides initial velocity which is 2.\nASSISTANT: You are right. The shortest distance between the beach and the oil rig is 6 m + 2 x 3 = 12 m.
