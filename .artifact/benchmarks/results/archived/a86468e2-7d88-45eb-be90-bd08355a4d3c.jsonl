This will involve creating the chatbot avatars, the virtual environment where the game will take place, and any other elements that are necessary for the game. For example, you might create a virtual store where the chatbots can interact with each other and the customer.\n3. Train the chatbots: The next step is to train the chatbots to play the game. This will involve providing them with a large dataset of customer interactions and teaching them how to respond appropriately based on the rules of the game.
