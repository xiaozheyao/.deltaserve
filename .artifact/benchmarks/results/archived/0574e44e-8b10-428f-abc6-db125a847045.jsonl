At this scale, the ordinary rules of classical mechanics no longer apply and strange, seemingly random events can occur.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum mechanics is that particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, known as superposition. This means that a quantum particle can be in more than one place at the same time, until it is observed and its state collapses into one of the possible states.\n\nAnother important concept is that of entanglement, where two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of the other, even if they are separated by vast distances.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts the existence of elusive particles such as quarks, which are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, and the Higgs boson, which is thought to give other particles mass.\n\nOverall, quantum mechanics provides a mathematical framework for describing the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, and has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the physical world. It has led to the development of incredibly powerful technologies, including computers and communication networks, and many of the greatest mysteries in physics remain to be unlocked by further research in this field.\n\n", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1714481688.2293105, "last_token_time": 1714481847.0744956, "start_loading_time": 1714481835.3735182, "first_scheduled_time": 1714481842.1111968, "cpu_loading_time": null, "gpu_loading_time": 1714481842.109479, "first_token_time": 1714481842.152904, "time_in_queue": 153.8818862438202, "finished_time": 1714481847.0744867}]}, "end_at": 4060014.997950353, "start_at": 4059856.143390994}
