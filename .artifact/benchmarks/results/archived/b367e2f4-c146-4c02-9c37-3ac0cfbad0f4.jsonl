Let's say that the length of one segment is x.\n\nSince the ratio of the two segments is 1:2, we can write:\n\nx / 6 = 2 / 1\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 6 \\* (2/1)\n\nx = 12\n\nSo, the length of the hypotenuse is twice the length of a segment, which is 12 cm.\n\nTherefore, the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 12 cm long.\n\nPlease note that we assumed that all sides of the right triangle are non-negative and that we rounded the length of the hypotenuse to the nearest whole number.
