For example, if you have a batch size of 2, each device processes half of the batch, and then the results are combined before training the next model iteration.\n3.

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy on a very small scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles.\n\nOne key concept in quantum mechanics is the idea of waves and particles. On a macroscopic level, we ordinarily think of objects as being composed of particles, such as atoms and molecules. However, on a quantum level, things can behave more like waves. This is represented by a phenomenon called wave-particle duality, which suggests that atoms and subatomic particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on the conditions under which they are observed.\n\nAnother key concept in quantum mechanics is the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a mathematical equation that describes the behavior of a quantum system over time. According to this equation, a quantum system evolves in a way that is similar to how it would behave if it were a wave. This concept is used in the field of quantum mechanics to describe how particles move and change over time.\n\nThere are many other fascinating ideas and concepts in quantum mechanics, including uncertainty principles, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, wave-particle duality, and various types of quantum particles such as electrons, quarks, and bosons.\n\nI hope this", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1714334626.784252, "last_token_time": 1714334732.9608552, "first_scheduled_time": 1714334626.8367307, "cpu_loading_time": 1714334626.8388946, "gpu_loading_time": 1714334626.8389235, "first_token_time": 1714334633.3975117, "time_in_queue": 0.052478790283203125, "finished_time": 1714334732.960845}]}, "time_elapsed": 215.89009515941143, "relative_start_at": 39.40295373648405}
