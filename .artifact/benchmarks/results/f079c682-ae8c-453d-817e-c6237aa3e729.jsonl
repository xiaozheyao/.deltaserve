Therefore, the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 12 cm long.\n\nTo understand how this works, you need to know that in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the altitude is 6 cm, so we know that the length of one of the other two sides is 4 cm (since the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1:2, and 6 cm divided by 2 is equal to 3 cm, which means that the other side opposite the altitude is 4 cm, since the length of the other side is always the opposite of the length of the altitude).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the other side that is opposite the hypotenuse. This side is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the other two sides, which in this case is the square root of the sum of the squares of 4 cm and 6 cm, which is equal to 8 cm (since 4 cm times 4 cm equals 16 cm, and 6 cm times 6 cm equals 36 cm, and 16 cm plus 36 cm equals 52 cm, which means that the length opposite the hypotenuse is the square root of 52 cm, which is equal to 8 cm).\n\nSince the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle and opposite the altitude, it is equal to the length of the side opposite the altitude plus twice the length of the altitude, which is 8 cm plus 2 times 6 cm, or 8 cm plus 12 cm, or 20 cm.
