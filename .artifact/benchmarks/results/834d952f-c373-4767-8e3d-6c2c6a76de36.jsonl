In simple terms, it claims that matter and energy can exhibit properties of both waves and particles at the same time. In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wave functions which are mathematical descriptions of their probable locations and energies. The mathematics used to describe quantum mechanics are called Hilbert spaces, which are mathematical spaces that can be used to represent all possible states of a particle. Geometric algebra is also used to represented quantum systems.\nThere is a law called Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, which describes how wave functions evolve over time. The most famous equation in quantum mechanics, it was first used by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in 1926 to describe the dynamics of an atom. The equation is still widely used in quantum mechanics today to describe the behavior of particles, from atoms and molecules to electrons and photons.\nQuantum Mechanics require an \u00dcberraschung (a surprise) to explain a quantized reality, that goes through the hidden variables approach.\nIt's more complex than", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens": 297}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1713254125.8934793, "last_token_time": 1713254189.0785608, "first_scheduled_time": 1713254132.2079403, "cpu_loading_time": 1713254132.2102537, "gpu_loading_time": 1713254132.2102816, "first_token_time": 1713254132.439088, "time_in_queue": 6.31446099281311, "finished_time": 1713254189.0785382}]}, "time_elapsed": 63.19200754724443, "relative_start_at": 6.600971061736345}

However, with great power comes great responsibility, and social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have an obligation to ensure that the platform is not being used to spread hate speech, misinformation, and other harmful content. In some cases, this may require the implementation of censorship measures to remove posts that violate community standards.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\nSocial media censorship is a highly contentious topic, with many people arguing that it violates free speech rights and restricts the ability of individuals to express their views online. Opponents of social media censorship argue that it is a form of government control over the internet and that it violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In some cases, the censorship may be an overreach, and may prevent individuals from expressing legitimate viewpoints or may lead to suppression of minority voices.\n\nIn summary, while social media censorship can be a necessary measure in some cases to protect users from harmful content, it can also violate free speech rights and restrict the ability of individuals to express their views online. The decision to censor content on social media platforms should be made with care, and with a recognition of the trade-offs between protecting users and upholding free speech rights.\n\nPlease refer to the transcript for more detail....\n\n[Transcript] \u201cShould social media censorship be allowed?

Configure the Express server to forward specific routes to your React app\n\nNow, we need to configure the Express server to forward routes to our React app. In our case, we want to use the next build of the app (which we'll build using `npm run build`). To do this, we need to set up a proxy. Proxies allow you to take a URL and specify which server should handle it.\n\nIn this example, we're going to proxy all requests to the `/static` folder to our React app. Here's how to do it:\n```javascript\n// express-webpack-app/config/express.ts\nimport express from 'express';\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// set up proxy middleware\n", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens": 401}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1713254133.4927173, "last_token_time": 1713254566.3346076, "first_scheduled_time": 1713254480.799773, "cpu_loading_time": 1713254487.8551683, "gpu_loading_time": 1713254488.1866276, "first_token_time": 1713254491.9795427, "time_in_queue": 347.3070557117462, "finished_time": 1713254566.3346014}]}, "time_elapsed": 432.8470294168219, "relative_start_at": 14.201759405434132}
