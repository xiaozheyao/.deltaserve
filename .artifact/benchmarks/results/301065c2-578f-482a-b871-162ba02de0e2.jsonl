COGS Ace is a cryptographic mechanism designed for secure on-device program synthesis in cloud-native applications.\nCOGS (Code-generating Objective-oriented Solution Synthesizer) is a Microsoft Research tool for inferencing the implementation of a black-box function using sub-graphs of neural networks and models from the call sequence. COGS solves a black box optimization problem, estimating model parameters together with the code implementation to minimize the criterion of interest. Currently used in data centers including Microsoft Azure, COGS has been used on several projects, such as Koplovsky, Vesole, and Kvitka.\n\u201cNow, we, too, were interested in leveraging generative models for", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens": 327}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715808799.6438203, "last_token_time": 1715809689.6750042, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715809354.0173426, "cpu_loading_time": 1715809354.0205345, "gpu_loading_time": 1715809358.478036, "first_token_time": 1715809358.655958, "time_in_queue": 554.3735222816467, "finished_time": 1715809689.6749916}]}, "end_at": 11027602.633953186, "start_at": 11026712.541775672}
