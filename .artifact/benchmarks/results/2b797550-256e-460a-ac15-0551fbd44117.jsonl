When we observe a particle, we collapse or \"measure\" its wavefunction, which determines its actual quantum state.\n\nAnother central concept in quantum mechanics is superposition, which means that a particle can be in multiple states simultaneously, such as spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time. This property allows for strange phenomena like entanglement, where two particles can become correlated in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics.\n\nQuantum mechanics also predicts the existence of quantum entanglement, which is an even more strange phenomenon, in which two or more particles become correlated in such a way that they can instantaneously influence each other's state, regardless of the distance between them.
