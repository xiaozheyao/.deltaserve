It is based on the principles of wave-particle duality and quantum superposition, and it allows us to understand the properties of these particles in terms of probabilities rather than definite values.\n\nAt the quantum level, particles are described by wavefunctions that can be thought of as \"probability waves\" that spread out over space. These waves are not localized in space like classical particles, but instead exist in a superposition of all possible positions. The behavior of these particles is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which describes how the wavefunction evolves over time.\n\nOne of the most well-known consequences of quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality, which states that a particle can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on how it is observed. For example, when light is shone on a metal surface, it can exhibit wave-like behavior by reflecting off the surface and interfering with itself, but it can also exhibit particle-like behavior by absorbing or emitting particles.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is quantum superposition, which states that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
