Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is a technique for fine-tuning pre-trained language models using fewer machine learning parameters than is typical. This can make the fine-tuning process faster and more efficient, especially when fine-tuning large models with millions of parameters.\n\nHere's how PEFT works:\n\n1. First, pre-trained language models are freeze-trained on a large corpus of text, with a fixed set of parameters, to capture general language knowledge. Freezing some parameters is equivalent to using standard fine-tuning, but with fewer parameters to learn.\n2. Then, a small set of additional parameters are trained to adapt the language model to a specific task or domain. These additional parameters are learned using gradient descent optimization, along with other parameters in the model. The parameter update rule maintains the pre-trained model's careful balance of general and task-specific knowledge.\n\nFor example, let's say you wanted to fine-tune a large language model on a", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 249, "completion_tokens": 225}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718121708.3610606, "last_token_time": 1718121734.439772, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718121708.4601457, "cpu_loading_time": 1718121708.4614449, "gpu_loading_time": 1718121708.4614508, "first_token_time": 1718121708.515899, "time_in_queue": 0.09908509254455566, "finished_time": 1718121734.4397333}]}, "end_at": 11349164.361617444, "start_at": 11349138.275641697}

This can be done by using a system that can convert heat energy into mechanical energy and then back into heat again. For example, a heat engine can be designed to convert the heat energy produced by a diesel engine into mechanical energy and then back into heat, allowing the diesel engine to continues running and producing heat. This would allow the perpetuum mobile to continue functioning indefinitely. However, it is important to note that such a machine would violate the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system must always increase over time. This would make such a machine impossible and any attempts to build it would be futile. Therefore, any claims of a perpetuum mobile that runs perpetually on a minimum amount of input energy would have to be considered as fraudulent or a scam. Inventors have been trying to create a perpetuum mobile for centuries, but so far, no one has succeeded in creating one that can function without breaking the laws of thermodynamics. However, if such a machine were to be discovered, it would likely revolutionize the field of physics and engineering.\n\nTo design a perfect machine which is a perpetuum mobile, it is important to understand the concept of entropy and how it affects the operation of machines.

However, there are different ways to convey the concept of color.\n\nOne way to describe the color red to a blind person is to use shape, texture, and movement. For example, holding a round object (like a ball or a fleshy fruit) can convey the idea of roundness, which is often associated with the colors red, orange, and yellow. The texture of the object can provide sensory information about its size and surprisingly, some objects emit a low-frequency vibration that can be felt when shaken, which can be associated with the color red.\n\nAnother way to describe the color red is through a tactile color", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 180, "completion_tokens": 159}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718121740.5683477, "last_token_time": 1718121758.754962, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718121740.6087306, "cpu_loading_time": 1718121740.6099832, "gpu_loading_time": 1718121740.6099868, "first_token_time": 1718121740.659719, "time_in_queue": 0.04038286209106445, "finished_time": 1718121758.754891}]}, "end_at": 11349188.677767519, "start_at": 11349170.483516889}

Give a distinction between censor and silence\nCensor    : Stop from being said / Written/ Published\nSilence   : Don't let hear\nSocial media censorship is objectionable for many reasons. First, it abridges the freedom of expression. Upholding a free society also is the government's responsibility. Second, censorship allowed by the government is determined to hold these platforms liable for the defamatory speech of users and the offensive content of hosted accounts. Also, it gives these social media companies the full authority directly determine what information can and cannot be posted on their sites, and these decisions could potentially be arbitrary or incorrect.\nInstead of users and companies focusing on what the foundations of expression should be when its used on anything, users will have to be more aware or sharp to know the longer discussion of what is right and wrong.\nSocial media censorship is necessary for many reasons. These include; saving lives, safety, and honesty between clients. Examples include, Facebook and YouTube removing child pornography, putting an end to real life suicides and informing current news about reported crimes (riots, terrorist attacks etc). Also, businesses should not utilize social media as a way to resell fake dietary aids or pharmaceuticals. Using social media platforms to get information out to people, corporations are destroying their reputations by providing misleading and false information to the public that could possibly cost them their jobs, cause adverse effects to their populations.\nFor a social media website to curb racism and filthy language, should be their obligation. Cursing, criticizing others racially is despicable and people have a right to seek measures to resist, and practice appropriate means to withhold.

When a star has exhausted the fuel in its core, it will collapse and begin to rapidly emit an enormous amount of energy, which causes a bright and intense outburst. This outburst is visible across vast distances, and is typically referred to as a supernova.\n\nSupernovae are of particular interest to astrophysicists because they are among the most luminous and energetic events in the universe. They are also important because they play a crucial role in the formation of other kinds of stars, including neutron stars and black holes. The energies released in a supernova can also have a profound impact on the surrounding interstellar medium, producing intense shock waves and penetrating the dust and gas of the universe to produce new elements.\n\nThere are several different types of supernovae, each of which is classified based on its appearance and the characteristics of the star that produces it. Some supernovae are relatively mild, while others are incredibly bright and can be seen across vast distances. In recent years, astronomers have used supernovae as \"standard candles\" to measure the distance to other galaxies, furthering our understanding of the universe and the origins of its structures and components.\n\nMicrosova is completely different but refer to website which explain it in detail. <https://apprecise.com/>\n\nHope this helps!
