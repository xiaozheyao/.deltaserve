Move the origin to the point where the altitude intersects the hypotenuse.\n2. Draw a vertical line from the origin to the hypotenuse.\n3. Measure the length of the hypotenuse using the ruler tool. In this example, the hypotenuse is 10 cm.\n\nSince the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1:2, we can divide the hypotenuse into two parts. The length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm, and the length of one segment is 6 cm.\n\nTherefore, the length of the second segment is 10 cm - 6 cm = 4 cm.\n\nIn conclusion, the altitude is 6 cm, the length of the hypotenuse is 10 cm, and the length of the first segment is 6 cm.\n\nPossible answer:\n\nAltitude: 6 cm\nHypotenuse: 10 cm\nFirst segment: 6 cm.\n\nNote: The length of the second segment is 4 cm.
