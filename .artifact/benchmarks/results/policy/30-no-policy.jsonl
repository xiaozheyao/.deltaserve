Quantum mechanics is considered to be the most successful theory in modern physics and has been experimentally verified countless times.\n\nOne of the key concepts in quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality. This means that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how they are observed. For example, when an electron is emitted from an atom, it can be considered a wave and spread out over a larger area. But when it is detected in a particular location, it can be considered a particle and localized at that point.\n\nAnother important concept in quantum mechanics is uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical quantities, such as position and momentum, cannot be precisely determined simultaneously. This means that the more accurately we know the position of an electron, for example, the less accurately we can know its momentum, and vice versa.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concept of superposition, which is the idea that a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
