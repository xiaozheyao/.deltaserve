It may be helpful to try out both Fuji and Nikon cameras to see which one feels more comfortable for you and meets your photography needs.\n\n\ubc88\uc5ed\uacb0\uacfc  \n\ud0dc\uadf8\ub294 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uc640 \ud544\uc694\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2e4\ub985\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud6c4\uc9c0\uc640", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 20, "total_tokens": 232, "completion_tokens": 212}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715848180.27672, "last_token_time": 1715849156.3766196, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715848197.6360867, "cpu_loading_time": 1715848215.3428502, "gpu_loading_time": 1715848215.4438035, "first_token_time": 1715848506.2293668, "time_in_queue": 17.35936665534973, "finished_time": 1715849156.3764913}]}, "end_at": 20659022.301991735, "start_at": 20658046.19042315}

Dispose of the old oil and install a new oil filter, using the oil filter wrench to hand tighten the filter.\n7. Re-attach the drain plug and tighten it to the manufacturer's specifications using the socket wrench.\n8. Start the engine and allow it to run for a few minutes to allow the oil to circulate.\n9.

You can use the `npm init` command to create a new project. Here's the code for the `package.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-expressjs-app\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"My ExpressJS app\",\n  \"main\": \"app.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"expressjs\",\n    \"typescript\"\n  ],\n  \"author\": \"Your Name\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n```\nNow, let's create a new TypeScript file `app.ts`. This will be our ExpressJS server. Here's the code for `app.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello, world!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server is running on port 3000.');\n});\n```\nThis code sets up a basic ExpressJS server that listens on port 3000 and sends a \"Hello, world!\" message in response to any requests.\n\nNext, let's create a new ReactJS app. You can use the `create-react-app` command to create a new app. Here's the code for the `package.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-reactjs-app\",\n  \"", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens": 401}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715848200.078007, "last_token_time": 1715849329.0529823, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715848506.2398663, "cpu_loading_time": 1715848506.2445364, "gpu_loading_time": 1715848506.244569, "first_token_time": 1715848545.2141933, "time_in_queue": 306.1618592739105, "finished_time": 1715849329.0529776}]}, "end_at": 20659194.97596773, "start_at": 20658065.992267292}

Here's a simple example of how to do it:\n```clojure\n(defn fibonacci [n]\n  (if (= n 0)\n    n\n    (recur (dec n) (+ (fibonacci (dec n)) (fibonacci (dec n))))))\n\n;; Example usage:\n(take 10 (fibonacci 8)) ; => (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55)\n```\nIn this code, the `fibonacci` function takes a single argument `n` which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate. It uses recursion to lazily compute the sequence by calling itself with decremented arguments until it reaches the base case of `n` being 0, at which point it returns `n`.\n\nThe recursive calls to `fibonacci` are structured with tail recursion, meaning the final value of the expression is the result of the last recursive call, and all intermediate results are discarded. This allows the function to optimizer away the explicit recursion and return the result in a single expression.\n\nThe example usage shows how to generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers starting at `8` using the `take` function from the Clojure standard library. The result is a lazy sequence of Fibonacci numbers that can be consumed incrementally.\n\nNote that this implementation of Fibonacci sequence is computationally expensive and inefficient for large values of `n`, as it requires generating all intermediate Fibonacci numbers. For efficient computation of Fibonacci numbers, it is recommended to use pre-computed values or closed-form expressions.\n\nHere's a more efficient solution using pre-computed values:\n```clojure\n(def fib-", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715848194.8767743, "last_token_time": 1715849336.2405565, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715848197.6360867, "cpu_loading_time": 1715848215.3428657, "gpu_loading_time": 1715848215.4438126, "first_token_time": 1715848506.2293668, "time_in_queue": 2.759312391281128, "finished_time": 1715849336.240536}]}, "end_at": 20659202.163095087, "start_at": 20658060.79129083}

Since the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1 : 2, we can write:\n\n* Segment 1 length = x/2\n* Segment 2 length = x/2\n\nWe know that the length of the altitude is 6 cm. So, using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can write:\n\nAltitude^2 = Segment 1 length^2 + Segment 2 length^2\n6^2 = (x/2)^2 + (x/2)^2\n36 = (x^2)/4 + (x^2)/4\n36 = x^2\nx = sqrt(36)\nx = 6 (given that the altitude is also 6 cm)\nx = 6\n\nSince the hypotenuse is half of the altitude, the length of the hypotenuse is also 6 cm. Answer: 6 cm.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem directly by writing:\n\n(hypotenuse)^2 = altitude^2 + (altitude/2)^2\n(hypotenuse)^2 = 6^2 + (6/2)^2\n(hypotenuse)^2 = 36 + 9\n(hypotenuse)^2 = 45\n(hypotenuse) = sqrt(45)\n(hypotenuse) = 7 (sqrt(36) = sqrt(6^2) = 7)\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse is 7 cm. Answer: 7 cm. Note: the first method is simpler and more straightforward. The second method is included as an alternative.\n\nThe length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle can be found with the Pythagorean Theorem. If you know the length of the altitude and the ratio of the segments it divides the hypotenuse into, you can solve for the length of the hypotenuse.
