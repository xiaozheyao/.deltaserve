Model Parallelism: This approach involves dividing the neural network into smaller parts and processing each part separately on different GPUs or threads.

Since the altitude divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1:2, we can label one of the segments as 3x, where x is some unknown value. The other segment will then be 6 - 3x.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. This states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the other two sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. So we have:\n\n(3x)^2 + (6 - 3x)^2 = (6^2)\n\nExpanding the expression and simplifying, we get:\n\n9x^2 + 9 + 36x - 36 = 36\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n9x + 36 = 36\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 14/9\n\nSo the length of the hypotenuse is:\n\nhypotenuse = 3x = 21/3\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 21/3 cm.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the altitude of a right triangle divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1:2 to finish this problem. Since the altitude is 6 cm long, the length of the hypotenuse can be found using the formula:\n\nhypotenuse = 2 \\* altitude / 1\n\nhypotenuse = 2 \\* 6 / 1\n\nhypotenuse = 12 cm\n\nTherefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 12 cm.
