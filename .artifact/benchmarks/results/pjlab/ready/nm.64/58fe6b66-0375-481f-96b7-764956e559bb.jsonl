The first and mostly important thing to learn is not to be interrupted by the problems generated by the practice. For example, if you choose to breathe slowly, consider that your breathing is slow and remains slow until you decide to speed it up. It is interesting to train a winding concentration through the entire respiratory cycle, because only something alive and awake will be able to keep its attention in one chapter. It will also find different areas of strength and relaxation in the sensation of each moment.
