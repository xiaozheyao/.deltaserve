Here's a simple example of how you can serve a ReactJS app from an ExpressJS server using TypeScript:\n\n1. First, create a new ExpressJS project using `npm init express --save-dev`\n2.

It takes one argument, `n`, which is the number of elements in the sequence to calculate. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it enters a loop that calculates the next element of the sequence by recursively calling itself with one of the previous elements as the new `a` value and the other as the new `b` value. The `rest` variable is used to store the remaining elements of the sequence that haven't been calculated yet. The loop continues until `rest` is empty, at which point the final result is returned.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n```\n(fibonacci 5)\n;; => (0 1 1 2 3)\n```\nThis will calculate and return the first 5 elements of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nNote that this implementation is \"lazy\" in the sense that it doesn't actually calculate the entire sequence at once. Instead, it calculates each element only when it is needed. This is more memory-efficient than calculating the entire sequence up front and can be useful for sequences that are very long.\n\nHowever, this implementation is not \"tail-recursive,\" which means that it uses a stack to store the recursion frame. This can lead to a stack overflow if the sequence is very long.
