It is a mathematical theory that describes how particles interact with one another and with the forces that govern their behavior.\n\nOne of the key principles of quantum mechanics is that particles do not have a definite position or momentum until they are observed. This is known as the uncertainty principle. Instead, particles exist in a state of superposition, where they can exist in multiple states at once.\n\nAnother important feature of quantum mechanics is that particles can be entangled, meaning that the state of one particle is directly linked to the state of another particle, even if they are separated by large distances.\n\nIn contrast to classical physics, which assumes that particles have definite properties and behave predictably, quantum mechanics suggests that particles are probabilistic in nature, and that their behavior is governed by a wave function. This wave function describes the possible states that a particle can be in, and the probabilities of those states occurring.\n\nQuantum mechanics has been incredibly successful in describing the behavior of particles and has led to many technological advances, including the development of lasers, transistors, and quantum computers. However, it is still not fully understood and continues to be a topic of active research.\n\nI hope this helps!

It uses recursion to compute each Fibonacci number and always returns the next number in the sequence lazily. This means that if you call `fibonacci` with a large number, it will only compute the first few numbers in the sequence and then return them immediately.\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with the number of Fibonacci numbers you want to compute:\n```\n(take 10 (fibonacci 10))\n;; (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89)\n```\nThis will return the first 10 Fibonacci numbers in the sequence. If you want to compute more numbers in the sequence, simply add more to the end of the `take` function call.\n\nYou can also convert this function to return the Fibonacci sequence as a list instead of a lazy sequence by wrapping the entire function in a `doall` call:\n```\n(def fibonacci-list (fn [n]\n  (if (zero? n)\n    '(0 1)\n    (lazy-seq\n      (cons (fst (fibonacci-list (dec n)))\n            (snd (fibonacci-list (dec n))))))\n  (doall (fibonacci-list n)))\n```\nThis function", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715908907.261496, "last_token_time": 1715909809.4680731, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715908913.44668, "cpu_loading_time": 1715908913.4511771, "gpu_loading_time": 1715908913.4512258, "first_token_time": 1715908958.4357245, "time_in_queue": 6.185184001922607, "finished_time": 1715909809.4680307}]}, "end_at": 11127716.36745772, "start_at": 11126814.152876932}

Protection of sensitive information: Social media censorship can help to protect sensitive information, such as personal details or confidential business information.\n2. Limiting the spread of misinformation: Social media censorship can help to limit the spread of misinformation, which can have serious consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\n3. Prevention of hate speech and harassment: Social media censorship can help to prevent hate speech and harassment, which can have a negative impact on individuals and communities.\n4. Maintaining social order: Social media censorship can help to maintain social order by preventing the spread of harmful or violent content.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\n1. Infringement of free speech: Social media censorship can be seen as an infringement of free speech and the right to express oneself.\n2. Lack of transparency: Social media companies may not always be transparent about why they censor certain content, which can lead to questions about their motives.\n3. Censorship of legitimate content: Social media censorship can also result in the censorship of legitimate content, such as political speech or news articles.\n4. Difficult to enforce: Social media censorship is difficult to enforce, as it can be challenging to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate content.\n\nIn conclusion, social media censorship can have both positive and negative effects, and the decision to censor content should be carefully considered. It is important to strike a balance between protecting individuals from harmful content and ensuring that free speech is protected. Social media companies should be transparent about their censorship policies and work to ensure that legitimate content is not inadvertently censored. Additionally, government oversight may be necessary to ensure that social media censorship is not used to silence dissent or infringe on individual rights.
