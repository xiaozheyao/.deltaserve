Start by removing the oil filler cap and using a turkey baster to remove any loose oil from the engine. Next, remove the drain bolt and allow the oil to drain into a drain pan. Once the oil has drained, replace the drain bolt and re-fill the engine with new oil. Finally, start the engine and allow it to run for several minutes to circulate the new oil through the system. This will help to remove any old, contaminated oil that may still be in the engine. It's recommended to consult the service manual for the specific year and model of your Porsche 911, which will provide the detailed step by step instructions for changing the oil. Also, it's important to take the car to a service center if you're not comfortable with these steps, they are experts in this field. you can also check the maintenance schedule of your car to find out the recommended interval for changing the oil and other maintenance.\nIt's also important to check the oil level and clean the oil filter on regular maintenance and also consult the service manual for the specific year and model of your Porsche 911 for more information. An oil change should be performed according to the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations, it can be found in the owner manual, usually found in the glove compartment or on the manufacturer's website. Additionally, it's important to use the proper OEM or approved aftermarket oil for your vehicle.

The `lazy-seq` ensures that the Fibonacci sequence is only computed as far as needed, which can be beneficial for large values of `n`.\n\nLet's walk through how the function works. The body of the function consists of a `if` statement that checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns a list containing just `n`. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself on `n-1` and `n-2`, and conses them together with `n` to form the next element of the sequence. This process continues until the desired length of the sequence is reached.\n\nNote that this implementation of the Fibonacci sequence assumes that the initial two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. If you need to start with different values, you can modify the function accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps!
