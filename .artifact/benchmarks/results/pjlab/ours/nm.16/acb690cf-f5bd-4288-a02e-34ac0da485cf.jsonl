CCSNe occur when the core of a massive star collapses, causing the star to explode in a massive burst of energy. TSNe, on the other hand, occur when a white dwarf star accumulates mass from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass and explodes.\n\nSupernovae are some of the most powerful events in the universe, releasing energy equivalent to millions of times the energy output of our sun. They play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies, including the production of new elements and the distribution of matter. They are also important for the development of life in the universe, as the heavy elements they create are necessary for the formation of planets and the building blocks of life.\n\nThe study of supernovae is an active area of research in astrophysics, and they are used as tools to study the properties of dark matter, test the theory of relativity, and study the large-scale structure of the universe.

The `a` and `b` variables represent the previous two Fibonacci numbers, and the `fib` function computes the next number in the sequence, given its index `n`. The `reduce` function is used to apply the `fib` function to the initial value `a` and the input `n` to obtain the final result.\n\nNote that this implementation is not optimized for performance, and may become slow for large values of `n`. A more efficient implementation can be achieved using memoization or tail calls to avoid recomputing previous values in the sequence.\n\nIf you'd like to test out other Fibonacci implementations or explore different ways of computing the sequence, you can check out the resources provided in previous answers.

Censorship can help prevent the spread of harmful content and protect vulnerable individuals and communities. For example, censorship can help prevent the spread of hate speech, which can incite violence and create a hostile environment for marginalized groups. Censorship can also help prevent the spread of false information, which can cause panic and harm public health.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\n\nCensorship can infringe on freedom of speech, which is a fundamental human right. Social media platforms should allow users to express themselves freely, as long as they do not violate the platform's terms of service. Censorship can also be used to silence marginalized voices and suppress dissent. It can be difficult to determine where to draw the line between harmful and acceptable speech, and censorship can be used as a tool to silence voices that challenge the status quo. Additionally, censorship can be difficult to enforce effectively, and can lead to the suppression of legitimate speech. It's important to balance the need to protect vulnerable individuals and communities with the need to preserve freedom of speech.\n\nIt's important to note that social media platforms have their own rules and regulations regarding the content that can be shared on their platforms, and can remove content that violates these rules. However, the decision to censor content should be made carefully and with balance, taking into account the potential impact on freedom of speech and the need to protect vulnerable individuals and communities. The role of government in censorship is controversial and should be carefully considered. Additionally, there are other ways to address harmful content on social media platforms, such as providing education and resources to users, and promoting diversity and inclusivity in the content that is shared on the platform.\n\nIn summary, social media censorship can be a complex issue, with arguments for", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 436}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715782123.415039, "last_token_time": 1715783008.5640433, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715782147.383696, "cpu_loading_time": 1715782149.034725, "gpu_loading_time": 1715782149.1322474, "first_token_time": 1715782224.240178, "time_in_queue": 23.96865701675415, "finished_time": 1715783008.5640361}]}, "end_at": 20592875.54395018, "start_at": 20591990.38621091}

Here is an example code:\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\ndef send_email(to, subject, message):\n    # Create a message object\n    msg = MIMEText(message)\n    \n    # Set the parameters of the message\n    msg['Subject'] = subject\n    msg['To'] = to\n    \n    try:\n        # Connect to the SMTP server\n        with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:\n            # Start the SMTP conversation\n            server.starttls()\n            server.login(\"your_email@gmail.com\", \"your_password\")\n            \n            # Send the email\n            server.send_message(msg)\n            \n            print(\"Email sent successfully\")\n            \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"Error sending email: \", e)\n\n# Usage example\nsend_email(\"recipient@example.com\", \"Hello from Python Email Service\", \"This is a test email from a Python email distribution service\")\n```\nIn this code, we use the `smtplib` library to connect to an SMTP server and send an email using the `MIMEText` class from the `email.mime.text` module. We then send the email using the `send_message` method of the `server` object.\n\nTo use this code, you need to replace `your_email@gmail.com` and `your_password` with your own email and password. You also need to update the `to` and `subject` variables in the `send_email` function to send the email to the desired recipient and with the desired subject.\n\nI hope this helps you get started with creating your own email distribution service in Python.
