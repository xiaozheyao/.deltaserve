Why are they fighting now?\nASSISTANT: hm... have you had them checked out by a vet for any underlying health issues that may be contributing?\nUSER: no they are healthy cats and haven't got sick for years. They have their xrays once every two months, recently updated vaccines and their toothe have been fixed. vet said they are perfectly healthy cats with no unhealthy habits.\nASSISTANT: well, there's no easy answer. When cats become sexually mature, their relationships will change. Even though they've been neutered, the change in their hormones is probably making them more aggressive, and these two cats are always around each other. If first you were redecorating your new home, it's safe to say the change in environment may cause them to feel stress too.\nHello, my Carina has started attacking my old male cat Murphy.

People can become overly dependent on social media for self worth\n\\end{code}\n\nWe notice that the data is definitely not clean, but we aren't surprised, it was pulled from the web :-)\n\nYou can test out my results for yourself with [NLTK 3](https://www.nltk.org/).\n\nThe code to test out is:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport nltk\n\nr = nltk.compat.StringIO(\"\"\"[ASK, simHeuristic(963,\"0.806944\"), simHeuristic(967,\"0.960156\"), simHeuristic(1020,\"0.811629\"), simHeuristic(211,\"0.889147\")], [USER, \"What is the transit route number between x and y\"], [USER, \"What are the facts about COVID 19\"]]\n\"\"\")\n\nprint(nltk.extract_entities(\"\"\"\nLedyard, Was composed in tribute to John Ledyard (1752-1789), the fourth of five sons born into a family with English and Scottish background.

Our economy is dominated by touristm and many people here wish we could diversify into some other areas so our economy could be more resiliant.

One idea I would like to explore is using seasteads to do ocean fertilization to grow more plankton, so grow more fish, so we could fish more without depleating fish stocks. We could have the seastead we are living on stay in the center of a large eddie current. Then maybe twice a day we could use flying agricuture drone or a small boat drone to spread some furtilizer in the 1 sq-km around the seastead. We would do a small amount of fertilier like 20 lbs the frist day and increase gradually to 200 lbs per day. We plan to fly a multispectral drone to collect data. We also plan to take water samples from near the seastead and do tests on those. What other data collection could we do? What data would indicate something bad was happening and we should stop the experiment?

Then follows a relation for the type signature of the transformation of the original goal statement, Much as F : \u03b1 -> \u03bc(\u220f t {/ (UK0 \u03b1)})\u2192\u0393. The relation shows that the types assigned to constants and functions are fully accounted for -- a rule can only be unscriptblocked if the entry in \u03b1 represents a constant or a function with clearer rules for terms. The relation is a specific case of motivations for AU because it shows not only how each rule is validated -- that is, how complementary types are found and assigned to all terms in the transformation -- but also shows how these evidence is condensed into the \u03b1 entry, meaning it answers to questions about the type information preceding F, the result of typechecking F .\nMight as well add my first actual (maybe?) prototype for het comp today.

The problem statement says that the length of the altitude divides the hypotenuse into segments with lengths in the ratio 1 : 2, so let the other side be h and write\nh 6s2\n. By the Pythagorean theorem,\ns2 a2 + h2\nwhich tells us that h must be 8 s.\nHow long is the altitude of the triangle?\nUSER: OK. So the length of the altitude is quotient of the hypotenuse, s, divided by 2, h. So altitude, a.\nASSISTANT: Correct. Now solve for the length of the hypotenuse, s.\nSOLUTION: Before a can divide s by 2, s must be divided by a so we can substitute the length of the altitude, a, for h, the hypotenuse, into the same ratio to solve for s.\nUSER: So if s (hypotenuse) equals 8 times a (the altitude), then the hypotenuse is 8 times the altitude. So subsituting h (=2a) into this ratio gives:\n8a/2a = 4a/a = 4\ns = 4a\nASSISTANT: So the hypotenuse is 4 times the length of the altitude. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 4 times the length of the altitude. And we know that the length of the altitude is a. So the length of the hypotenuse is:\nSOLUTION: To solve for the length of the altitude, a.\nUSER: So the length of the hypotenuse is 8a, which we know is 4 times the length of the altitude.

The two primary ways to help promote your business are running Facebook ads or opting in to a Facebook business page. Once you've setup both of these options, and most importantly, you need to make sure you have access to business tools that your potential consumers might find valuable. So, if you're running Facebook ads on your mobile device and want people who visit your business page to find an app icon in their top left of their menu page, this is where having a Facebook app might help you.\nBuilding a Facebook app takes time, but it can increase engagement and exposure to users by a great margin. What's great about building a Facebook app is that you have full access to roll out at a quick and organic rate. With Facebook business Page, anyone who visits the site must opt for it on their timeline, which makes it harder and harder for people to find your business and how to connect with you as time goes on.

With classical mechanics (the prevalent model in physics from ancient Greece through the mid-20th century), we understood the combination of space and time, but it wasn\u2019t until Einstein would discuss quantum mechanics (a model popularized by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, among others) that the foundation was laid for modern physics.\nClassical physics is appealing to all scientists, because of the \u201cphysics holds no surprises\u201d style it conforms to. It is intuitive, even if the calculations are less so. Everything happens as predicted and once predicted, no other future outcomes are possible. This is very sensible and easy to understand for our classic physics.\nQuantum physics on the other hand is completely different. It is more akin to a magic 8 ball.

There are two things to consider when building a search engine: crawling and indexing. For crawling, you\u2019ll need a crawler \u2014 a computer program that systematically browses the world wide web, retrieving and indexing information from web sites. The second thing to consider is indexing web pages \u2014 once you collect and store data from sites, it must be organized and catalogued using algorithms so that users can retrieve information when they need it. In terms of what computer languages you should use, Python would likely be your best bet. Its array operations, regular expressions, network sockets, urllib, selectors, and OpenBabel, for example, would be extremely useful in building a crawler. And additional libraries like styled-components or pyfaro would definitely come in handy too. Chrome Dev Tools is a great tool for looking at web page source code and copying it. Python also has good data structures such as dictionaries. It\u2019s also worth investigating Black.

This allows the model to be trained and fine-tuned more efficiently, as it doesn't require as much computational power.\nUSER: What are some examples of where PEFT can be applied?\nASSISTANT: PEFT is particularly useful for tasks with large input data and complex models, such as question-answering, image classification, and natural language processing. It can also be used for tasks requiring low-latency inference on small embedded devices, like mobile phones and microcontrollers.\nUSER: Great, thanks for the explanation!\nASSISTANT: My pleasure!

The following is a pattern comparison between Abstract Factory and Factory Method. It also includes a UML diagram to better understand how to use each pattern.\nAbstract Factory - Provides an interface for creating families of related objects and makes it easier to follow the same logic to create those objects (for example, an address book factory can create different types of address books, each with different methods for adding a person).\nFactory Method - Provides a \"constructor\" for objects that can make the same kind of object each time (like a line printer or a conveyor belt).\nFACTORY METHOD PATTERN :\nFactory method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables us to acquire - create objects via a Factory Object without specifying the exact class of the objects that we want to create. It puts creation of an object outside the class.\nAs a result, you can change the class of the newly created object without modifying the code of client classes that use the factory.\nSo, what are these patterns good for? So a \u201cWhat are the different between Abstract Factory and Factory Method\u201d . If you would like to have an object of one of many types during runtime, if you need to defer instantiation of objects to a subsystem that does it for you, of if you have an object and its descendants, you can say that you where using the Factory Method pattern. On the other hand, the Abstract Factory pattern comes handy if behavior implemented by different classes is very similar.\ntheby: whats the differences between abstract factory and factory method? while working at a programming company, I was assigned the task of determining the differences between abstract factories and factory method.\nAssistant: Excellent question, theby. Abstract Factory is a classic create-object pattern, that creates an instance of one object from a family of related objects. For example, let's say you have an \u201cAbstract Factory\u201d for creating objects such as generic day and night shifts moving about in the heavens from one day to the next. In addition to day shifts at first light to sunset, and night shifts from after sunset to first light, a factory for day and night shifts also creates various \u201cwaxing\u201d and \u201c", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens": 471}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718308430.173955, "last_token_time": 1718310219.4684186, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718309602.8580098, "cpu_loading_time": 1718309616.2073915, "gpu_loading_time": 1718309616.9422889, "first_token_time": 1718309646.5623655, "time_in_queue": 1172.684054851532, "finished_time": 1718310219.4683585, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23120090.40002391, "start_at": 23118301.09735648}

This data is used to train the model to understand the patterns and relationships between words and phrases. \nUSER: ok please expand more detailedly\n\n\nThen model gets trained until prediction power starts to get boost and even then they continue to train further\nASSISTANT: Yes, after the model is trained with the initial data, it goes through more training to improve its accuracy and usefulness. This process of continued training is called fine-tuning, and it can improve the model\u2019s performance by making it more specific to a certain task or domain, or by using additional data sets. \nUSER:\nASSISTANT: One way fine-tuning might be done is to continue to train the model on data that is similar to the task it is designed to perform. For example, if the model was trained on general English language data, it might be fine-tuned on data from specific domains like legal language or medical language.\nASSISTANT: Another common type of fine-tuning involves using a pre-trained language model as a starting point and then training it further on specific data or language tasks. For example, a model like GPT-3 can be fine-tuned on a large dataset of legal documents to make it more likely to generate language that is coherent and acceptable for legal documents.\n\nUSER: please give more \nASSISTANT: Yes, here are a few more examples of how fine-tuning can be used:\n\n\nUSER: what is domain specific fine tunning\nASSISTANT: Domain specific fine-tuning involves training the language model to perform a specific task or set of tasks, such as generating text that is relevant and coherent within a specific domain like legal language or technical documentation.\n\nUSER: give an example of jokes and templates \nASSISTANT: Jokes and templates are two examples of fine-tuning that involve using a pre-trained language model as a starting point and then training it further on a domain or specific task.\n\nIf a joke is a subset of jokes you want your", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 27, "total_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens": 480}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718308593.8480632, "last_token_time": 1718310448.2988017, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718309678.6740706, "cpu_loading_time": 1718309694.695183, "gpu_loading_time": 1718309696.3561833, "first_token_time": 1718309728.2539537, "time_in_queue": 1084.8260073661804, "finished_time": 1718310448.2987494, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23120319.23163614, "start_at": 23118464.77305178}

For skills such as POTA, which require temporally close sequences of tokens, Softmax is insufficient. One way to overcome this limitation is to use Layered Softmax smoothing. OpenAI proposes several methods for generating images using DALL-E, including Compositional Image Generation, Text-conditional Image Generation, and Image-conditional Image Generation. In terms of compositionality, OpenAI\u2019s methods achieve a surprising level of control.\nOpenAI accomplishes this by constructing a pipeline of independently trained classifiers: negative and positive samples to foster positivity in training, an engaging content classifier and a coherence mapping, and a set of six core abilities. Coupling these with together with GPT2, where VQGAN generates images from text, yields an 80% success rate at decomposition with training minimization. Upon further training, OpenAI achieves an 80% success rate at decomposition with losses mod 0.04.\nThis paper asks an important question: How can you force a language model to hallucinate?\nConclusion The ultimate goal of language modeling is to generate human-like sentences by encoding the statistical complexity of entire corpora. This paper proposes a new method for enforcing hallucination in a language model, and evaluates its performance against those hallucinated images.
