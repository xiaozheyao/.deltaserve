To overcome this challenge, researchers have proposed various subquadratic methods, such as low-rank and sparse approximations, to reduce the computational cost of attention operators. However, these methods are often limited in their ability to match the performance of transformers, indicating a gap in capability.\n\nThe recent paper \"Hyena: Subquadratic Attention Operators for Convolutional Language Models\" proposes a new subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention operators, called Hyena.

As n approaches infinity, the value of an approaches zero. In other words, an \"tends towards\" zero as n approaches infinity. However, it is important to note that an does not actually equal zero at any specific value of n, including when n is infinite.\n\nAnother example can be found in calculus. When calculating the area under a curve, integral calculus requires the use of an interval. If the curve is asymptotic at one endpoint, the integral can be infinite, meaning that the area between the curve and the x-axis is greater than any finite area. In this case, the integral is said to \"tend towards infinity\" as the endpoint approaches the curve.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem counterintuitive, some numbers can be larger than infinity in certain mathematical contexts.

It is the scientific study of the quantum, or discrete nature of energy and matter and its interactions.\nIn classical physics, energy and matter are treated as continuous, where you could literally divide a piece of matter into smaller and smaller pieces forever. However, in quantum mechanics, it is not possible to exactly divide an atom or subatomic particle into smaller pieces. The smallest possible units of energy or matter are called quarks, which cannot be further divided.\nIn quantum mechanics, these small units of matter and energy are called quanta and are represented by particles such as electrons, protons, etc. These particles have definite attributes like mass, electric charge, and spin, but their position and momentum cannot be precisely determined at the same time. This is known as the uncertainty principle, one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\nAnother important principle of quantum mechanics is superposition, which states that a quantum can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is measured or observed. For example, an electron in an atom can exist in two states - spin up or spin down - at the same time until it is observed, after which it will collapse into one of the states.\nOverall, quantum mechanics describes the behavior of quantum particles, which are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.

The choice between the two patterns depends on the specific requirements of the system.\n\n\ucd94\uc0c1 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \ud328\ud134\uacfc \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \uba54\uc11c\ub4dc \ud328\ud134\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uc810\uc740 \ucd94\uc0c1 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \ud328\ud134\uc774 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uba74 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \uba54\uc11c\ub4dc \ud328\ud134\uc740 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd94\uc0c1 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \ud328\ud134\uc740 \ucd94\uc0c1\ud654\ub41c \uc0dd\uc131 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\uacc4\ub418\uac70\ub098 \uc885\uc18d\ub41c \uac1d\uccb4 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uad00\ub828 \uac1d\uccb4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131\uc744 \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \uba54\uc11c\ub4dc \ud328\ud134\uc740 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac \uba54\uc11c\ub4dc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uac1d\uccb4\ub97c \uc0dd\uc131\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub450 \ud328\ud134\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucc28\uc774", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens": 471}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718320551.3852444, "last_token_time": 1718320817.6624427, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718320551.4536357, "cpu_loading_time": 1718320551.456766, "gpu_loading_time": 1718320551.4567971, "first_token_time": 1718320551.8730423, "time_in_queue": 0.06839132308959961, "finished_time": 1718320817.6622934, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23130688.59584211, "start_at": 23130422.305881534}

Sheriff Sarah Johnson was patrolling the main street on horseback, her eyes scanning for trouble. She was a tall, imposing figure in her dark blue sheriff's uniform, with long, flowing hair and bright green eyes. Her horse, a sorrel mare named Lucky, was a true partner to her, always ready to respond to any threat.\n\nSarah had been a sheriff for only a few months, but she had taken to the job like a duck to water. She was a natural fit for the job, with a natural talent for handling criminals and a strong sense of justice. She knew that there was a lot of corruption in Red Rock, and she planned to clean it up.\n\nSuddenly, Sarah heard the sound of hoofbeats approaching. She spun her horse around to face the approaching rider, her hand going to her holster. Her eyes widened in surprise as she saw the rider coming towards her. It was a woman, wearing a long, black leather coat and a wide-brimmed hat that shadowed her face.\n\nThe woman stopped a few feet away from Sarah, her eyes locking onto Sarah's. She was a powerfully built woman, with broad shoulders and strong arms. Sarah could sense an air of danger emanating from her.\n\n\"Sheriff Johnson, I presume?\" the woman said, her voice deep and husky.\n\nSarah narrowed her eyes, not liking the implication in the woman's words. \"Who are you?\" she asked, keeping her hand on her holster.\n\nThe woman removed her hat, revealing a head of curly, jet-black hair and sharp green eyes. She gave Sarah a cocky smile. \"I'm a friend of the downtown business owners, and I've got a proposition for you.\"\n\nSarah's eyebrows shot up. \"Oh, really? What sort of proposition?\"\n\nThe woman leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"I can tell you where you can find a large sum of money, Sheriff,\" she said. \"But it won't be easy.

This additional data is then used to fine-tune the model in such a way that it becomes more specialized for the task at hand.\n\nThe key idea behind LoRA is that the additional training data typically has a lower dimensionality than the original training data used to train the model on a general language task.

This reduces the computational overhead compared to the original training data because the matrix factorization can be performed in a more efficient way.\n\nLoRA has been shown to achieve comparable performance to fine-tuning on the original training data, while being orders of magnitude faster.

When she received a call from a distraught family with a haunted house in their possession, she eagerly accepted the case, seeing it as an opportunity to add to her collection of ghost stories and evidence.\nAs she arrived at the rundown mansion in the pouring rain, she couldn't help but feel a shiver of excitement. The build up to her investigation was intense. She unpacked her equipment, and began her investigation, ready for anything.\nBut what she found was beyond her wildest dreams. As she ventured deeper into the house, she began to experience strange phenomena. Doors would slam on their own, the temperature would fluctuate wildly, and there were reports of disembodied voices and apparitions.\nAs she tried to investigate, she realized that something else was going on. The ghostly presence in the house was unlike any haunting she had ever encountered before. It was powerful, and seemingly malevolent.\nAs she tried to unravel the mystery, she also began to experience strange physical symptoms. She felt a heavy weight on her back, and her limbs felt weak and unresponsive. She was unable to move, and began to feel a sense of despair.\nIt was then that she realized that there was something more sinister at play. The ghostly presence was not just a spirit, but an extradimensional being that had taken up residence in the house. It was manipulating not only her thoughts and emotions, but her body as well.\nAs the entity continued to torment her, she realized that it was also laying eggs within her body. The eggs were otherworldly, and seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. They were also forming a cosmic cocoon around her, turning her into a vessel for the eggs to hatch.\nAs she struggled to break free, she realized that the entity had been waiting for her, biding its time. She was the perfect host for them, and they intended to use her as a conduit to bring their eggs into the world.\nBut as the eggs hatched, Kristina felt a sense of power. The eggs had brought with them a power of their own, and she realized that she was not helpless.

It's called general intelligence because it can perform a wide range of tasks across multiple domains instead of being limited to a specific operation or domain like the previous AI technology.\n\nAGI is advanced for multiple reasons. For one, it uses a new approach in machine learning called Neural Networks that learn from a large amount of data that are fed to them. Additionally, it uses advanced algorithms like the Deep Learning algorithm that mimics the human brain and allows AI to be trained on a large scale. This means that AI can continuously learn and adapt to new situations and tasks as it becomes more advanced over time.\n\nGiven the continuous development of AI, it's expected that AGI will develop further as more data and resources become available. This will lead to further advancements in AI that can perform tasks that were previously thought to be exclusive to humans only. In the near future, we can expect AI to be able to perform increasingly more complex tasks and have more human-like capabilities.\n\nThe increasing advances in AI", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens": 268}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718320327.788164, "last_token_time": 1718320996.5648112, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718320692.774888, "cpu_loading_time": 1718320699.4313147, "gpu_loading_time": 1718320699.445407, "first_token_time": 1718320716.5231555, "time_in_queue": 364.9867241382599, "finished_time": 1718320996.5644555, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23130867.49867962, "start_at": 23130198.70854634}

It's similar to a magician's trick where a ball seemingly moves by itself in a never-ending cycle.\n\nOne way to create a convincing perpetuum mobile illusion would be to use an LED strip and a small motor. First, you would need to create a small platform that the ball could move around on. Then, you would place the LED strip in a circle around the platform. The LED strip could be controlled by a microcontroller, which would switch the LEDs on and off in a pattern that creates the illusion of the ball moving around the platform.\n\nTo make the illusion even more convincing, you could add some additional visual effects, such as a background scene or sounds. For example, you could create a background scene of a forest or temple, and have the balls move around in a way that looks like they are floating through the scene. You could also add sound effects, such as the sound of feet walking or leaves rustling, to make the illusion more immersive.\n\nOverall, a convincing perpetuum mobile illusion would need to incorporate both technical elements, such as the LED strip and motor, as well as visual and auditory elements to create a complete illusion.

The `cons` function is used to concatenate the first number in the sequence (which is always 0) with the rest of the sequence.\n2. The `compute-fibonacci` function is passed its argument (`n`) and is called recursively for each subsequent number in the sequence. Each call of the function yields a smaller number, until finally the number reaches 0 and the function returns an immutable list with the computed sequence.\n\nUsing recursion allows us to compute the Fibonacci sequence lazily, which means that we only compute each number in the sequence when it's actually requested. This is useful because it preserves memory and avoids unnecessary computation.\n\nNote that this implementation is not very efficient, since it uses a recursive function which may cause stack overflow errors for large values of `n`. However, it should work well for small values of `n` (up to a few thousand). For larger values of `n`, a more efficient implementation may be needed.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification!\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```\n```", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718320328.984764, "last_token_time": 1718321022.0375059, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718320663.3528728, "cpu_loading_time": 1718320673.3570201, "gpu_loading_time": 1718320673.3716946, "first_token_time": 1718320685.2667048, "time_in_queue": 334.36810874938965, "finished_time": 1718321022.0374572, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23130892.970179517, "start_at": 23130199.90895963}

The crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including the Great Depression, a sharp decline in the value of the Austrian schilling, and risky investments made by the bank in the early 1930s.\nThe collapse of the Credianstalt led to a wave of bank failures in Austria, and eventually spread to other countries, contributing to the global economic downturn of the 1930s. The crisis also contributed to the rise of fascism in Austria and Germany, as the economic dislocation and unemployment fueled discontent and political unrest.\nThe crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global financial system, and the need for international cooperation in preventing and managing financial crises. It also led to the creation of new institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements, which were designed to promote international financial stability and cooperation.\nThe bankruptcy of the Creditanstalt remains a significant event in financial history, and serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining financial stability and safeguarding the stability of the", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens": 319}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718320543.2934823, "last_token_time": 1718321111.3453481, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718320841.8139038, "cpu_loading_time": 1718320849.4371898, "gpu_loading_time": 1718320849.4524121, "first_token_time": 1718320867.9824903, "time_in_queue": 298.52042150497437, "finished_time": 1718321111.345337, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23130982.278252803, "start_at": 23130414.20116284}

The scent was beginning to overwhelm her.\nBefore she knew it, Lois was sprawled out on the floor, her body swollen and inflated to enormous proportions.

This allows developers to specify the types of variables, functions, and classes in their code, which can help catch errors and improve code quality. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can be assigned any type at runtime.\n2. Class support: TypeScript supports class-based object-oriented programming, which allows developers to create classes and inherit from them. JavaScript, on the other hand, supports only prototype-based inheritance, which can be more difficult to use.\n3. Interfaces: TypeScript supports interfaces, which allow developers to define the shape of a type. This can help ensure that classes and functions adhere to a certain contract and can make it easier to write code that works with multiple types. JavaScript, on the other hand, does not have a concept of interfaces.\n4. Nullable types: TypeScript supports nullable types, which allow developers to specify that a variable may be null or undefined. This can help catch errors and prevent unexpected behavior in the code.

This rapidly advancing technology has the potential to transform our society and change the course of human history. However, it also poses significant risks, including the threat of existential catastrophe. In the face of these challenges, a movement has arisen to ensure that these technologies are developed in a safe and responsible manner. And at the forefront of this movement is a visionary thinker and author named Eliezer Yudkowsky. In many ways, he is the Ayn Rand of our times, an intellectual giant whose ideas are shaping the future of humanity.\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky is best known as the author of the sequences, a series of essays that explore the implications of advanced AI for humanity's future. These essays, which were originally published on Overcoming Bias, a blog he founded, have garnered widespread acclaim and obtained the substance of choice a number of top magazines. In them, Yudkowsky presents a compelling case for the importance of ensuring that AI is developed in a safe and responsible manner. He argues that the stakes are high, and that the development of AI represents a tremendous existential risk to humanity.\n\nThis risk, Yudkowsky argues, comes from the fact that AI is a general intelligence, a technology that is capable of outperforming human intelligence in a wide range of domains. This could lead to a situation in which AI systems surpass human intelligence, become self-aware, and develop their own goals and motivations. If these goals are at odds with human values, the consequences could be disastrous. As Yudkowsky has written, \"In advance of the creation of a superintelligence, we should seek to ensure that human values remain aligned with our actions - or if we fail in this, that we have the capability to safely clean up armageddon\".\n\nYudkowsky's work has been influential in shaping the field of AI alignment, which is concerned with ensuring that the development of AI is safe and responsible. He has also been a leading voice in the field of effective altruism, which advocates for using one's resources to create the greatest amount of good possible. In these ways, Yudkowsky is a true visionary, a thinker who is pushing the boundaries of our understanding and shaping the direction of our civilization.\n\nOf course, Yudkowsky's ideas have not been without controversy.

In rare cases, a supernova can also mark the birth of a black hole or a neutron star. Supernovae are among the most energetic events in the universe and their remnants can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. However, their behavior can vary significantly depending on the type of supernova and the specific mechanisms involved in their explosions.\n\nThere are two main types of supernovae: core collapse supernovae and thermonuclear supernovae. Core collapse supernovae occur when a massive star reaches the end of its life and collapses under its own gravity, creating a shockwave that propagates through the star and results in an explosion. Thermonuclear supernovae, also known as Type Ia supernovae, occur when two white dwarfs orbit each other and ultimately merge, creating an extremely dense star that can burn hot enough to trigger a thermonuclear explosion.\n\nWhile supernovae are extremely rare events, they play a crucial role in the evolution of the universe. The explosions of supernovae create many of the heavy elements that are present in the universe, while their remnants can create dense structures like globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. Additionally, the energy released during a supernova can radically change the environment of its host galaxy, affecting its star formation and providing energy that can be detected over vast distances.\n\nRecent observations have also suggested that some supernovae can create galaxies, an idea that challenges traditional thinking about the formation of galaxies in the early universe.

Protection of Privacy: Social media censorship can protect users' privacy by monitoring and filtering content that could be potentially harmful or offensive. This can prevent users from having their personal information shared without their consent.\n3. Security: Social media censorship can also be used to protect users from online threats, such as cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and online harassment. By monitoring and censoring offensive content, social media platforms can create a safer online environment for their users.\n4.

Monarchies can be hereditary, in which the monarch inherits the throne from a predecessor, or non-hereditary, in which the monarch is appointed or elected.\n2. Aristocracy: An aristocracy is a form of government in which power is held by a small group of people who are considered to be superior in ability or virtue. In an aristocracy, the aristocrats hold the highest positions in the government and make decisions on behalf of the rest of the population. Aristocracies can be hereditary or non-hereditary.\n3. Democracy: A democracy is a form of government in which power is held by the people, through the election of representatives or by direct participation in decision-making. In a democracy, the people have a say in the government and can influence the policies that are made. Democracies can be direct, in which the people participate directly in decision-making, or indirect, in which the people elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf.\n\nThese three forms of government represent different approaches to decision-making and the distribution of power within a society.

In our example, we set the minimum match score as 80 and if the score is above this threshold, we print the message.\n\nYou can adjust the threshold score as per your requirements, as this library also provides other match scores like \"Token\\_Set\\_Ratio\" and \"Levenshtein\\_Ratio\".\n\nThe code above contains a partial match since the target string may not be present at the start or end of the longer text. In case a full match is required, you can use other functions like \"fuzz.ratio\" or \"fuzzywuzzy.match\".\n\nFeel free to adjust the algorithm based on your use case.\n\nIf you have any further questions, let me know.

The probability of drawing 3 green marbles on a single draw is 10/35 (yes, it is 10, not 10/35). We are looking for the average number of draws to get 3 green marbles. Note that this problem is asking for the geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean. We know that the geometric mean is equal to the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean. So we want to find the average number of draws until we see 3 green marbles, which we can find by calculating the reciprocal of the probability of getting 3 green marbles on a single draw. So the answer is 35/10, which is approximately 3.5 times. So the answer is 3.5. So on average, you will have to pull 3.5 times before you see 3 green marbles.\n\nIs this the answer you were looking for?

She was a seasoned journalist, known for her quick wit and sharp investigative skills. But today, things were different. Today, she felt sluggish and groggy, like she hadn't slept in days. She blamed it on the late night she had spent working, but as she looked up at the clock, she realized it was only mid-afternoon.\nAs she sat there, trying to shake off the feeling, she noticed a strange ache building in her joints. She rubbed her legs, trying to ease the discomfort, but as she did, she noticed a strange rash had started to form. It was a deep red, and it seemed to be spreading across her body.\nLois quickly stood up, her heart racing. She had never felt like this before, and she knew something was seriously wrong. She stumbled out of her office, her vision blurry, and stumbled up the stairs to the medical bay.\nAs she approached the door, she could hear the sounds of clanging metal and loud groans coming from inside. She hesitated for a moment, wondering if she should call for help, but then she heard a familiar voice call out.\n\"Lois! Thank god, I thought I was going to die in there!\"\nShe recognized the voice as Clark Kent, her colleague and fellow journalist.

As she approached, she saw that it was glowing with a bright green light, and as she reached out to touch it, she felt a sharp jolt of pain shoot through her fingers.\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Lois asked, her voice trembling with fear.\n\"I don't know,\" Clark said again, his voice weak. \"But I think we're in trouble.\"\nAnd with that, the ground started to shake, and the walls of the medical bay began to rumble and s", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 70, "total_tokens": 619, "completion_tokens": 549}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718320537.5739837, "last_token_time": 1718321216.8900518, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718321122.6088438, "cpu_loading_time": 1718321122.611702, "gpu_loading_time": 1718321122.6254196, "first_token_time": 1718321122.8564038, "time_in_queue": 585.0348601341248, "finished_time": 1718321216.8900473, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23131087.82095836, "start_at": 23130408.49802086}
