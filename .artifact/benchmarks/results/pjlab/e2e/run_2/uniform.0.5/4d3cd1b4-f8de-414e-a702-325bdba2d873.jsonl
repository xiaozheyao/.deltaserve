Hello! [NAME]!\nUSER: How to train concentration and memory?\nASSISTANT: Indeed concentration is one of the most important mental skills that we should develop.

Then you need to fill with the last letter, the word that you found before helped respectively to different letters (eg.: Fill the last letters. A -B-, B \u2013C-, C \u2013D- \u2026. The words will be: amber, roast, broth, roast, underground, death, edifice, the futile, with air, taut, hand, derelict etcetera). You have to train 5-10 min each exercise during doing some routine activity: driving, waiting in transport or watching tv. Also you can use some more simple words for recognizing the letters. Do this exercise daily. Delete from memory the workout as you see fit. Practicing this exercise will greatly improve your memory of the alphabet. The second technique is based on writing a word and thinking of another one with that first on the same theme: Eg.: \u201csun\u201d thought \u201cmoon\u201d. \u201cdrink\u201d - \u201cthirst\u201d. \u201crich\u201d \u2013 \u201cpoor\u201d etcetera.

It is a special case of a family of more binary trees.\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{Question:}\n\nThese questions can have a large number of related answers. In these cases, should we extract only the main context answers and evaluate only those tokens as B instead considering the others answers context as C, or are they evaluating every wrong answer in the background?\n\nI would like to know in such cases, which is the best way to generate predictions.\n\nAnswer: BERT does not require the answer to be a full sentence or even an entire statement. It should just be a reasonably contextually relevant string extracted from the context that best represents the intended meaning. I am not sure what approach BERT takes behind the scenes, but it may take a few of those answers as context and evaluate against only those tokens as B instead of consdiering the others in that way or another.\n\nRegarding the answers / predictions, it should be enough to have these be single words, short phrases and / or easely rediscoverable entities. Breaking the answers down to one or two keywords is totally valid. Which approach would give the best results depends on your specific dataset, although I would guess a small fully focused approach would possibly perform better.\n\nP.S. PyTorch ThiSBNot (pytorch-thsbn) is able to take answers as short as a single word. There are examples provided in the txt2hyp sample which use one word answers, although the actual dataset it self doesn't have those.\n\nAnswer: The document for ThiSBNot says that \"SENTENCE FROM FULL DOCUMENTATION\" can be given and that escaped < > symbols might need to be removed. However, it is not specified how much context we need to provide to threshold in Hypotz format. I would try to address and incorporate the all approaches suggested by ratty3210's answer.\n\nhttps://thi.sci.ga.gov.au/docs/latest/thsbn/contribution/#short-answer-part-7-text-input-and-", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens": 483}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718330518.3106318, "last_token_time": 1718330823.326976, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718330518.6509626, "cpu_loading_time": 1718330518.652768, "gpu_loading_time": 1718330518.652779, "first_token_time": 1718330518.768799, "time_in_queue": 0.3403308391571045, "finished_time": 1718330823.3268976, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 23140694.25861528, "start_at": 23140389.23523602}
