First, the large number of parameters to be processed by the GPU can lead to memory bandwidth bottlenecks, making it difficult to train models with more than a few billion parameters. This is because the GPU needs to pull in data from main memory and send it back to the main memory to compute the data, which can slow down the overall process. Second, the large amount of data required to train such large models can only be stored on slower, higher-capacity storage devices such as NVMe drives, which may not provide enough bandwidth to keep up with the demand of the GPU. Third, the energy requirements for running such large models can be significant, putting a strain on the power supply and potentially leading to higher energy costs. Finally, the physical space required to house the hardware for such large models can be prohibitive, especially considering that it may be necessary to upgrade existing hardware to accommodate larger models. As a result, the current state of GPU hardware has limitations when it comes to scaling large language models to enormous sizes, and improved hardware will be necessary to achieve this goal.\nUSER: How does ChatGPT perform in terms of user engagement and brand awareness for ?\nASSISTANT: ChatGPT\u2019s user engagement and", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 27, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens": 280}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718203513.3229542, "last_token_time": 1718203775.5244946, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718203513.500688, "cpu_loading_time": 1718203513.5029497, "gpu_loading_time": 1718203513.5029602, "first_token_time": 1718203513.68624, "time_in_queue": 0.1777338981628418, "finished_time": 1718203775.5242655, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 19562556.52397451, "start_at": 19562294.312539723}

This can be done by finding a substring in the longer length string by replacing any of the characters from the shorter length string. This would give us the shorter length substring in the long string. To make the replacement, we would need to find the shorter text within the longer text where the substring has the maximum possible match.\nThe code below finds a substring in a larger string such that the characters in the sub-string have maximum occurences in the longer string. The algorithm proposed here is obviously less accurate than brute-force string matching. The algorithm only finds substring where the characters in the substring of length x have maximum occurrences in the length y string (where x is smaller than y).\nLike knot algorithms, we can use the Aho-Corasick algorithm to generate all the possible substrings which match the substring to be replaced. We can pass the start and end points passed by the brute-force algorithm as the state in the Aho-Corasick algorithm. Then we can build a list of matched sub-strings and perform the string replacement.\nWe pass designated sub-string for partial match with arbitrary sub-string length. When we don\u2019t pass sub-string, we simply replace the query string with the text string. We would obviously get better results if we built the Aho-Corasick string search algorithm for partial match.\nThe algorithm is purely relying on the frequency of characters in the bigger string, which is obviously not going to give us preferred match for some characters (e.g compare with the sub-string \u201cBronx.\u201d and \u201cpark\u201d in the match of the query \u201cUnique Hotel in BRoNX.\u201d with the text \u201cUnique Hotel is a five-star unique hotel in BRoNX park.

Farmers settled down to work the land. This led people to grow corn, wheat and barley for food. Their villages also became larger for protection from beasts and other humans, which led to cities developing around groups of villages. Farmers learned to make better tools.
