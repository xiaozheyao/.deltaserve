In time-lapse analysis, where images of an area of interest are acquired on multiple days, pansharpening increases the image resolution so the pansharpened image is greatly improved in detail compared to the individual images that make up the study area.\nBecause the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) in the GeoEye-1 satellite is composed of 1m panchromatic and 4m multispectral data, Pansharpening is available on 1m products in RapidEye technology and orthorectification order. In RapidEye, this is available as long as two data files, optically and spectral bands, are used to make the Pansharpening process.\nIn the case of multispectral data in orthorectification order, you will have to access geoEye order to use the multispectral data. In total, ABI's pansharpening quality depends on the phase you are in. With high-quality data and good weather conAtions, results with 1m resolution can be obtained, while the resolution may deteriorate in ABI.\nYou can view ABI pansharpening data on the desktop by signing in to GeoEye Explorer.

There are also the number of websites including Microsoft that suggests to explicitly assign value to the properties, especially for public methods. So working without typing is not a recommended approach.\nThere\u2019s always help to choose from. Click on the link in your comment above and go for suggestions.\nWhat would happen if I give a type for public method? Wouldn\u2019t it add some extra check? Won\u2019t that be harmful? I am not against setting the type, but in my scenario setting the type won\u2019t add any value but will add some extra check.\nIt\u2019s not checked in the browser to be correct not type-checked. The value types are simple alternatives and very similar to the types of primitive values you already know in JS. On the server side if you\u2019re using TypeScript or Flow to build your code regular types will be added to the structure.\nHi Iggy! You could type react components as class components, functional components or class components with HOC pattern, I think. I do.\nDelusional yes you can. But think about a case that you have huge codebase than by end of time there will be need to change the to this.element. You won\u2019t be able to go through all code and fix them right. public will eliminate the issues without need to change. That\u2019s why its recommended practice.\nThere is no reason to switch to public if you are in a well documented project and keep conventions.
