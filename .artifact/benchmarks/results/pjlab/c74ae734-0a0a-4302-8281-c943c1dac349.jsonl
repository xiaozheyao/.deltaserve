The architecture Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models.

After a long dry spell with low rainfall and drought putting a strain on locally grown flowers, several years of rainfall are needed before one can officially declare it a super bloom. As it turns out, the last super bloom in California was in 2019, which was quite a banner year in terms of blooms, and one that has been talked about and widely photographed. The best places for a super bloom in California include Death Valley, Antelope Valley, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, although we", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 19, "total_tokens": 212, "completion_tokens": 193}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718237748.2858536, "last_token_time": 1718238578.4273343, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718238373.027603, "cpu_loading_time": 1718238373.0308354, "gpu_loading_time": 1718238376.055115, "first_token_time": 1718238376.2853217, "time_in_queue": 624.7417492866516, "finished_time": 1718238578.4272578, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 19597362.456092883, "start_at": 19596532.308665782}

A real human. And, sometimes, the human is better than the bot itself. But, not always. Especially, when the human is given limited parameters and then rewards/punishes the bot based on its answers, the robot answers in an unsurprisingly vapid fashion -- no matter how knowledgeable the person who made it may be.\nI've always claimed that the biggest benefit of artificially intelligent bots is that they can answer the same questions over and over without getting grumpy at customers or, at the very least, repeating rudimentary details. To help flesh out this potential fantasy, I created a dungeon crawler chatbot company called AdventureBot using my personal experiences working with Google's Dialogflow CX, GPT-3, ChatGPT, Bard AI and OpenAI. Instead of dying during combat and having no beneficial consequences, each automated campaign simulates the closest RPG experience available (in my tests) that's close to fully integrated into Slack.\nSpoilers: They are less than optimal, but they (sometimes) work.\nThis series of stories pertains to two fields: technology and wizards.
