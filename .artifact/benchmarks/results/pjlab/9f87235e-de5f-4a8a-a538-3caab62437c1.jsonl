Sometimes the network can actually figure out how to accomplish complex things like 'fitting a two dimensional data set into a one dimensional space.'

Typically a visible color sensor, ie Landsat, is paired with an instrument, like Thermal IR, that can penetrate cloud and has higher spectral resolution. The two sensors together provide much greater information content than either can on its own. The visible color sensor is able to determine pigment and texture of objects whereas the infra red sensor is able to detect temperature. When the two are combined, the pigments and textures observed by the visible color sensor, and the temperatures observed by the infrared sensor can be co-registered, or aligned into grid cells matching the visible color pixel grid from the sensor. While the two are matched up in this way, programs are written that look at properties of the visible color image and estimate the same properties at the infra red sensor pixel locations. This is a form of spectral stretching, the same principle used to create false colors in a color saturation filter in paint or image processing applications like Photoshop. However in the spectroradiometer image, it is looking at visible colors and comparing their properties to the invisible electromagnetic emissions, electrons and protons, that are being reflected back from the Earth's surface.

The advantage of using binary trees over other ways of storing functions/data is that it requires less memory when stored on a computer than other arrangements of data. For instance, if one wanted to store function calls in Python to execute later, we would ordinarily have to put them all into memory and perform an action as appropriate: MyObject().PerformAction()`. If you wanted to store 50k of calls like this, we would need 50k times the amount of memory required to store a single object: MyObject().PerformAction().

The API allows developers to add their own plugins to the GUI. The best way to do this is by using the Terminal service. There are two steps involved: First, you need to create a terminal object in your Python script. When you create this object, you can provide the following information: - Connection type (accepts LXTerminal or Terminal) - User credentials (Normally these credentials are already authenticated) - Connection parameters (accepts 'no-archive', 'yes', or 'no') Second, upon creating the terminal object, you can issue a \"Call\" command from your Python code. This will create a query within the Terminal service which we will then proceed to process. However, before issuing this command, it's important that you've already installed TerminalService in your project:\npython manage.py coding -t bin7evolution_audit all query success-view screen. Get the IP of the API server by going to Academy. Get the user id of the QA team by going to Administration and selecting first-access-view. Create an API key by going to Administration and selecting admin-view screen.
