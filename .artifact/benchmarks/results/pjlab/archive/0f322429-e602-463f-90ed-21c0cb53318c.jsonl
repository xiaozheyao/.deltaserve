This isn't to say that AI is useless in these spaces, and AI utopianists are totally wrong. But what AI is actually good at is extending our capabilities. Extending positive capabilities (such as spreading useful information) are great, while extending negative capabilities that amplify our worst tendencies (such as our ability to spread fake news) are more troubling.\nArtificial intelligence is making progress. We are deciding what we want it to do. Paying even closer attention through thought experiments is thus an important step to making sure AI can help us realize the wonderful things we want to achieve.\nEveryone's been talking about AI as an issue that we'll worry about it in the future. Right now it\u2019s just a fad and we all want to get in before we miss out on a wave.\nYet people willing to say AI is going to destroy jobs essentially goes untested.

Com\nUSER: Pyradi is a software package which can find a fast approximate string search(FASTA) based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) of two strings.\nPyradi\u2019s FASTA is an efficient approximate text search. The algorithm is capable of performing efficient approximate character string search for similar word study in genome molecular data research.\nFor example: The first three letters of the DNA sequence AAT, AAA, ATC, ATT, ATG. The chemical composition of AAT, AAA, AAA, ATC and ATT are all the same, TAT. But when TAT is researched as a biological character or DNA sequence, it will appear as four characters T,A,T, A,AT,C, T, etc. In this case, approximate text search will be very helpful so that what TAT looks like can be replaced with four identical T, are more efficiently researched through the approximate string search.\nThinking about it, the purpose of the approximate text search is to achieve the information statistics of the pattern characteristics used in biological research, therefore improve the processing efficiency.\nIf you are interested in how Pyradi results are displayed, please see its manual.\nhttps://github.com/radimk/pyradi/wiki/About-PyRadi-Result\nDetails related to BWT will be studied in the next article.\nIt is time that we learn how to install and configure our system for the next few articles.
