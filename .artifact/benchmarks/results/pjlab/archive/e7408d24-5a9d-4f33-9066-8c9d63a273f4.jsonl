Chatbots are widespread, and the most advanced chatbot out there can be built using the Bot engine in Solidity, an open source blockchain-based platform. To build your own chatbot, you will first need to develop a basic understanding of the Solidity programming language and the fundamentals of blockchain. Additionally, it\u2019s a good idea to familiarize yourself with AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing) if you want to create a highly interactive and sophisticated chatbot. With the proper knowledge, you can use tools like Ecereum to create a wide variety of bot models.\nAs you begin to build your chatbot, the first step is to identify what type of functionality it will have. Are you running on a bot engine? If so, you\u2019ll want to find out what behaviors you want the chatbot to demonstrate, such as providing answers to a particular set of questions, responding quickly to inputs, or even dialoguing with users. Once you\u2019ve identified the desired functionality, you can decide on the best hardware platform to run the bot on.

But when Gorgeous Sue was walking down the road looking like a velveteen angel, no one on earth actually looked at anyone else. No earthly thing would steal anyone's gaze away until Gorgeous Sue was out of sight. Which she made very brief, happening by were it didn't matter for Mother Henny Sue snagged the odd egg that had lightly sprung left in someone's lap for their own stupid reasons.\nBut Gorgeous Sue preferred the egg that had been boiled, then scrambled for two or more steam-filled minutes in a cast iron minister's skillet, the whole skillet sizzling beneath the steer beef that required a very long time cooking because sometime at about breakfast in the very morning hours Gorgeous Sue would have children not her own. None east of the Texas-Buds came to the Poverty-Mallow with anything she wasn't either owed or wanted from Gorgeous Sue. And Gorgeous Sue wasn't called by such a name for no reason, except maybe every boy wanted to, and her husband, Wild Bill Hiccup, won every bar room brawl without getting a mark on his shirt then letting her start on his belly and fist fuck him like a royal to her throner.\nIt has died to writ since Wild Bill gave up gunslinging to run the Union bank from where he'd blown off Big Reynoldo's head with a shot from his right-hand six-shooter shoveled into the renegade mustache of the original mayor of the Red Creek village of Poverty to become a celebrity of the West.

They are designed to ask users a series of questions and provide the user with the best option based on the answers.\nThird, you must decide on the user interface for the chatbot. You can use a platform like Chatfuel or Microsoft Bot Framework to design the user interface. Choose a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use buttons that make it easy for users to navigate the chatbot.\nFourth, you must decide on the type of language you want to use.
