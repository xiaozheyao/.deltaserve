I sent the organizers an email requesting to be added as a submitting author. They replied, asking for a title and an abstract.\nThe heading for the technical session it will fall under is SSD in Aerospace & Defense. So the title went as follows: Space-Related Concerns When Using SSDs On Critical Mission-Critical Computers.\nThe abstract for the presentation is as follows:\nConventional wisdom of using Solid-State Drives in space is to not use them. That is, assumption is like using a tape-up drive; expect the source of your corruption to be within the drive. This assumption is highly suspect! Disk drives exhibit things like bit-rot, too.

Mark lectures regularly on the impact of intelligent machines on society and has testified before the United Nations and the European Parliament on the subject. In a recent interview I conducted with Yarnall, he commented on the nature of the human-machine integration, the development of an effective trust mechanism, and the value of important ontological considerations in the design of intelligent machines.\nAre intelligent agents in effect human-machine hybrids?\nMark Yarnall: Yes and no.
