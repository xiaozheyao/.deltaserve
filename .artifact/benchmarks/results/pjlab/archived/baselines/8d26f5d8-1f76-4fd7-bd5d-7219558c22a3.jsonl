That\u2019s what you should communicate to the DO.\nThe possibilities are universal because , that is, the lenght a has no bearing on .\nUser solution: The altitude to the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1 : 2. The length of the altitude is 6 cm. The hypotenuse is 24.\nCorrect solution: The altitude to the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the hypotenuse into two segments with lengths in the ratio 1 : 2. The length of the altitude is 6 cm, allowing that the hypotenuse is the sum of two segments with lengths 3 vertices.\nRIGHT TRIANGLE RATIO: In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The length of a side of one right triangle is 13 inches. How long is the hypotenuse?\nASSISTANT: NEAR CORRECT : You are almost there.
