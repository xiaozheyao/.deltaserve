That one was worth the trip.\nFounded in California in June 1968, the electronic company Atari produced a series of electronic games, including the arcade game \"Pong\", which's user interface design is quite similar to the design of Alexa.\nA first prototype of an Alexa-like artificial intelligence was developed by the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) for the American Department of Defense, 1978\u20131986. This project came to a halt when Ronald Reagan became president. Intimately tied to the Cold War and the arms race of the 1980s, it was the realisation that talking computer systems would enhance the efficiency of nuclear weapons that drove the development: the rationale was that \"speech interfaces can enhance accuracy and reduce reaction time, thus resulting in firepower that is safer to use\".\nANCIENT MAYAN CARVINGS\nThe Chichen Itza Mayan ruins were rediscovered just after Columbus's conquest of the New World.

Reichardt, Steve Lutz, and Brad Colleran. A sample chapter is available online. Now first, a warning: the book is heavily biased towards DOS.\nIn the 1980\u2019s computers became firmly implanted in the clinical environment, and have been nothing short of revolutionary in terms of both patient care and behavioral research. Today, computer networks and home computers have spawned social support, information access, and treatment modifications while expert systems have promised something virtually invasive. Future computer applications in behavioral medicine look like they will continue to improve patient care.\nReichardt, S.S., Lutz, S., & Colleran, R.S. (1989). Computers in behavioral medicine.

Here's how I did it: My initial approach to this problem was to instantiate an array containing the different numbers of marbles in the urn and calculate the probability of a blue marble being pulled 3 times before a draw in green. For instance, if I were to pull a blue marble the first 6 times, I would have the chance to choose a green marble since the 6th dra (by process of elimination) will come out in the hundreds, even allowing for rounding errors. The odds would be \n15 / (15+15+10) = 11 / 40. The problem with this approach is that every time the urn is disturbed, the odds change. I tried using monte carlo simulation but decided it would take too many iterations. So I opted for the more analytical approach of Essence functions. The thing that made this possible was Gnomes. I created a deep product function that will produce all the possible combinations of marbles pulled. Each combination has its own essence. I monitor all the four marble combinations to make sure in the probability that at least three green marbles are pulled. If the number of combos pulled are greater than 697 visits (the number of possible unique pools of 3), I recalculate the success rate and continue to track them until I make it. This method will converge to the desired value fairly quickly.\n\n<a id=\"ctxt_Graph\"></a>\n\n![Experimental Graph](Graph)\n\n<a id=\"ctxt_Table\"></a>\n\n\n|Elapsed Time|Train Examples| Probability of 3 green marbles at the 1st dra | \n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| 00:06:55.772332|1505082|0.925 |\n\n\n<a id=\"ctxt_Code\"></a>\n\n```python\n", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens": 440}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715940211.6939855, "last_token_time": 1715940637.023759, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715940238.238211, "cpu_loading_time": 1715940238.2423697, "gpu_loading_time": 1715940238.2423975, "first_token_time": 1715940239.2392535, "time_in_queue": 26.544225454330444, "finished_time": 1715940637.0235848}]}, "end_at": 11158549.98478439, "start_at": 11158124.642626252}

After a few generations, the witches became devoted to granting their own wishes through the suffering of others. They gathered mountains of bones, the marrow of which they squeezed into serums that reversed the aging process. Inside the castle they built deep in the forest, the seven witches grew ever immortal, while the servants they tortured and murdered returned as their vampiric slaves. Eventually, an emissary of an ancient god punished the witches by condemning them to the deepest parts of the underworld. And still there they languish in solitude, chained to silver trees that bear strange and bloody fruit. From time to time, they smell a familiar odor and a shadow wraith appears, slipping in as a member of a new family descended from one of the witch\u2019s slaves. Eager to escape her final punishment, the witch staggers through glimpses of sleeping faces while the wraith carries the key in its hollow eye sockets.\nThe Assistant becomes calmer and returns to its normal state.\nUser: Tell my a story about middle garden\nAssistant: The Assistant suddenly becomes quiet and a laser light begins pulsing from inside the speaker causing the user\u2019s entry point to low key sink in the Assistant\u2019s speakers.\nAssistant: The Assistant suddenly becomes quiet and a laser light begins pulsing from inside the speaker causing the user\u2019s entry point to low key sink in the Assistant\u2019s speakers.

Don't mind if I do...\nAre you expanding your business in the healthcare industry? Do you need to improve customer engagement with respect to their needs? The problem of healthcare healthcare app development is that, poor planning processes and lack of resources mark a companies promotion.\nStill, the challenge hasn't stopped many businesses from outdoing one another. So, if you're planning your own healthtech startup, here are a few dos and don'ts you might wish to consider.\nDos for Healthcare App Development\nWork on Engagement - It's crucial to place the consumers at the center of your initiatives. Customize the app and website by bespoke design so as to customize the content to satisfy the requirements of modern healthcare customers.\nResearch Industry Trends - Trends come and go, but healthcare industries have adapted to trends over the past years. Best-in-breed technologies aren't likely to replace great concepts, as users are always on the lookout for things that add value to their offerings. Make sure you are up to date with the healthcare trends and seek out the best version with the best mobile app.\nMake It a Breeze to Use - Are you aware that it's not about doctors and insurance companies anymore? It's all about users. You need to grasp - as both a developer and a doctor - how important it is to engage with user needs and do so in a clear, simple, and friendly way to guarantee the smooth running of the app.\nIntroduced Design Options - There's a chance that every business with an app idea turns down the idea, as design isn't as impressive as building a compelling UI in an app. Many users judge an app to be either easy to use or fit for purpose, forgetting about branding and design. Custom app developers are able to add action buttons, footnotes, information bars, active icons/buttons, feedback forms etc to provide an attractive and nice design.\nDon'ts for Healthcare App Development\nNo proper Planning - Many startups and businesses are", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 22, "total_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens": 459}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715940220.293031, "last_token_time": 1715941713.6752927, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715941170.869756, "cpu_loading_time": 1715941180.3432703, "gpu_loading_time": 1715941181.1223736, "first_token_time": 1715941181.396269, "time_in_queue": 950.5767250061035, "finished_time": 1715941713.6752367}]}, "end_at": 11159626.635719696, "start_at": 11158133.244987123}

I will explain Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT).\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is a methodology that has been proposed to overcome the problem of lengthy fine-tuning of parameters. It addresses the issue by efficiently approximating the parameters, which allows to process a large dataset in a short time.\nThe principle behind PEFT is to leverage existing knowledge from past useful models to study a large set of accurate models on a small fraction of the full dataset. The idea is then to use an outfield approach to distill the key features of those good models for use in other, similar models.\nThe principle has been recognized to be able to suppress negative performance for rapid learning, high recall, and high accuracy.\nI hope this brief introduction has been helpful.
