It takes extra effort to do good work. It takes real thought and time to puzzle things through. It\u2019s much too tempting to cut corners. But cutting those corners is not innocuous, and it\u2019s not victimless. Sometimes the bad results will be innocuous. But sometimes they will take an ugly form, as seen here. That need for extra time and effort is a challenge for any science. And in recent years it\u2019s become more difficult. Universities face immense pressure from administrators, legislators and sometimes even parents. Many are now emphasizing that all research is practical and important. This often means pandering to politicians and religious pressure groups.

I think you're being a bit surprisingly overly charitable to this entity, but here you go.\nAlthough Ayn Rand called herself a novelist, her novelistic activity was not the core of her artistic activity. If you squint hard, the centerpiece of her artistic activity is not The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, which incorporated much of her systematic philosophy as mere novelistic subplot, but the vicious essay \"The New Sacrament of Victimology\", an extended attack on the theory-space of left-wing ideology, an attack which is less anti-communist in some ways than it is anti-the-notion-of-communism.\nIn the same way, Eliezer Yudkowsky uses stories as mere messenger service for his philosophy, and his philosophy is not philosophical arguments such as \"Watch out, you could realize that breastfeeding is kind of arbitrary\", but replies to the whole topic of \"What ambiguity is, and whether ambiguity can be reduced in general\".\nIn contrast to Rand's explicit position of making literature that has an ethos, Eliezer wrote Bayesian Conspiracy with no trace of his ascription of ethos to it -- it is not improved by virtue, nor hindered by vice. His pattern of well-tested heuristics fits in an unusually well with the idea that personal fables, narratives of geniuses who saved the world seven times by inventing X while twenty, and heroic allegories in all their forms, just move people to try harder.\nHis philosophy cannot be reduced to a two-page manifesto. Its background section can be condensed to two or three paragraphs describing a Bayesian prior and updating it by violating it. His rebarbative positions on tiling affection across many bodies, whether the mental emotions are called up even when we're tired, or the moral sweet spot of shared mental space, are built on Bayesian principles about dishonesty, and these in turn tie in with the waste-heat cascades of nichable mental self and alignment markers, building at the core of his artistic product a rebarbative philosophy research program (which he openly invites other rationalists to undercut or disregard) as far as that still counts as the same old ...", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens": 598}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715939226.6481054, "last_token_time": 1715940815.0121133, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715939743.1142786, "cpu_loading_time": 1715939776.747881, "gpu_loading_time": 1715939779.0450232, "first_token_time": 1715939787.0816286, "time_in_queue": 516.4661731719971, "finished_time": 1715940815.0120666}]}, "end_at": 17299596.01016369, "start_at": 17298007.63489607}
