This means that the sequence is not evaluated until it is actually traversed or forced. \"Forcing\" a lazy sequence can be done using the `clojure.core/dotest` function, which will evaluate the entire lazy sequence.\n\nHere's how you could use `lazy-seq` to create a Fibonacci sequence:\n```\n(require '[clojure.core :as core])\n\n(defn fib [n]\n  (if (= n 0)\n    0\n    (if (= n 1)\n      1\n      (fib (- n 1)))))\n\n(def fib-seq (lazy-seq (unless (zero? (dec n)) (core/dotest (fib n)))))\n```\nIn this example, `fib-seq` is a lazy sequence that computes the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence. It returns a sequence that contains the `n`th term, which is computationally expensive because it involves many recursive calls, only when the sequence is actually traversed.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to compute the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence, you could do the following:\n```\n(take 10 (fib-seq))\n```\nThis would force the lazy sequence and compute the full sequence. This may take a while for large values of `n`. You can also use `nth` to access individual terms of the sequence, like this:\n```\n(nth fib-seq 5)\n```\nThis would return the 5th term of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nI hope this helps!
