Once you have a trained model, you can export it to ONNX format using the appropriate tools provided by the deep learning framework you used for training.\n\nAssuming you have a trained model in ONNX format, you can use the ONNX runtime library to load the model and perform inference. Here's some sample code that demonstrates how to do this in Python:\n```python\nimport onnx\nimport onnxruntime\n\n# Load the ONNX model\nmodel_path = 'path/to/your/onnx/model.onnx'\nsession = onnxruntime.InferenceSession(model_path)\n\n# Define the input\nuser_input = ' Your input here '\n\n# Prepare the input for the model\ninputs = session.get_inputs()\ninputs[0].name = \"user_input\"\ninputs[0].shape = (1,)\ninputs[0].data_type = onnx.T", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens": 327}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715935328.400148, "last_token_time": 1715935888.5017502, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715935360.7705963, "cpu_loading_time": 1715935360.7748463, "gpu_loading_time": 1715935360.7748766, "first_token_time": 1715935447.5124598, "time_in_queue": 32.37044835090637, "finished_time": 1715935888.5017452}]}, "end_at": 20745757.552982274, "start_at": 20745197.44305977}

If it is, it returns a list with `n` as its only element. Otherwise, it calls `fibonacci` with `n-1` and `n-2` as its arguments, and returns the resulting lazy sequence.\n\nThis means that the sequence is only computed as far as necessary, so it is computationally efficient.\n\nI hope this helps!
