To improve memory, try to focus your attention on one thing at a time and notice the details around you.\n2. Take breaks: Concentration can be improved with regular breaks. Take short breaks throughout the day to give your brain a rest.\n3. Exercise: Regular exercise has been shown to improve memory and concentration. Exercise helps increase blood flow to the brain and can lead to the growth of new brain cells.\n4. Get enough sleep: Sleep is important for memory consolidation. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to improve your concentration and memory.\n5. Eat a healthy diet: A healthy diet can help improve concentration and memory. Foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants can help protect brain cells and improve cognitive function.\n6. Engage in mental activities: Engage in mental activities such as puzzles, crosswords, or Sudoku to challenge your brain and improve concentration and memory.\n7.

The function returns a lazy sequence, which only evaluates its elements on demand. We use the `if` statement to check if the first value of the sequence is 1 (for `n=1`) or 2 (for `n>=2`). For any `n`, if the sequence is going to be longer than the value of `n`, we return the lazy seq `(+ (fib (dec n)) (fib (dec n)))` (the symmetric sum of the two recursive calls to `fib`). For any other `n`, we return the Rec adventure 1.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n```\n(take 10 (fib 10))\n;; => (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55)\n```\nHere, we create a lazy sequence starting with the value of `fib 10`, which is the value `21`, and pass that to `take`, which returns a normal sequence of the first 10 elements. The watson sequence is lazily evaluated and the output is (1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55).\n\nIf you want to use `fib` with a loop, you could write a `doall` as follows:\n```\n(take 10 (doall (fib 10)))\n```\nIn this case, `doall`", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718040776.439938, "last_token_time": 1718040945.5473883, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718040822.653665, "cpu_loading_time": 1718040824.1304107, "gpu_loading_time": 1718040824.1947792, "first_token_time": 1718040824.7704396, "time_in_queue": 46.21372699737549, "finished_time": 1718040945.5473125}]}, "end_at": 19399726.544517227, "start_at": 19399557.42950563}

This little matter of user privacy had forced Facebook to appear before Congress and been covered on the front page of at least half a dozen major newspapers. While touring Facebook's recruiting and community resources centers, I was struck by the light-hearted, fun vibe. It's a place where students are whizzing around campus in e-scooters, and I was invited to attend a beer tasting event the following day. \"It's great working at Facebook. You're five steps from Alec Baldwin,\" quipped one of the engineers giving me the tour. Another impromptu tour guide, a young engineer in a shirt with a shark on it, sipped from his coffee cup, and the air smelled of fresh brewing coffee from their hip-looking Starbucks. After the scandal, I also happened to be on the same train shuttle when security rerouted special visitor badges to the front of the train and pulled regular Facebook staffers out of line, forcing us to show our badges.\nOne of the common refrains heard from Facebook employees was some variation on \"it's really", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens": 436}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718040823.351308, "last_token_time": 1718040952.0669672, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718040824.774401, "cpu_loading_time": 1718040824.7770708, "gpu_loading_time": 1718040824.7770889, "first_token_time": 1718040825.0277205, "time_in_queue": 1.4230928421020508, "finished_time": 1718040952.0668194}]}, "end_at": 19399733.064016923, "start_at": 19399604.338756155}
