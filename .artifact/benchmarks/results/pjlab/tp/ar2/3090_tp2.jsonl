It was developed in the early 20th century to describe the behavior of electrons and other particles in atoms, and has since been extended to explain a wide range of phenomena, from the properties of materials to the nature of spacetime.\n\nQuantum mechanics is based on the idea that particles such as electrons can exist in multiple states simultaneously, known as a superposition. These states are described by quantum mechanical wave functions, which give the probability of finding the particle in a particular location. The behavior of particles is governed by quantum mechanical laws, which dictate how wave functions evolve over time and how particles interact with each other.\n\nOne of the most famous aspects of quantum mechanics is the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties are inherently uncertain and cannot be precisely measured simultaneously. For example, you cannot determine both the position and velocity of an electron with perfect accuracy.\n\nAnother key concept in quantum mechanics is entanglement, in which the quantum states of separate particles become interconnected so that the behavior of one particle can affect the behavior of the other, regardless of the distance between them.

Protection of minors: Social media platforms are used by underage users who may be exposed to inappropriate content. Censoring such content can protect minors from harmful material.\n2. Protection of public health: The dissemination of false information, hate speech, and misinformation can harm public health by inciting violence, spreading misinformation about health risks, and contributing to stigmatization of marginalized groups. Censorship can help prevent this.\n3. Protecting national security: Some forms of speech can pose a threat to national security, such as inciting violence or advocating for terrorism. Censorship can prevent this kind of speech from being propagated on social media platforms.\n\nArguments against social media censorship:\n\n1. Violation of free speech: Censorship can restrict the freedom of speech and expression, which is a fundamental right in many countries. This can lead to a chilling effect on speech, where people self-censor their online activities due to fear of being censored.\n2. Openness and transparency: Social media platforms have historically been associated with openness and transparency, and censorship can undermine that reputation. This can lead to a lack of trust in the platforms, and users may migrate to alternative platforms that do not engage in censorship.\n3. Technical feasibility: Censoring certain types of speech on social media can be technically difficult, if not impossible. This is particularly true for content that is highly dynamic and frequently updated. It may be impossible for algorithms to keep up with new material, leading to over- or under-censorship.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments for censorship on social media, these must be balanced against the dangers of censorship, such as the violation of free speech and undermining of openness and transparency.

The standard deviation of this number is approximately 2.49, which means you can expect to see 3 green marbles in as few as 3.54 draws (85% of the time) or as many as 9.69 draws (5% of the time).\n```\nNote that the number of draws required to see three green marbles will fluctuate over time. The average number of draws will continue to rise as you draw more marbles, and the variance will decrease.

She was feared and respected by mortals and demons alike, but her thirst for power was insatiable.\n\nOne day, the witch decided she wanted to increase her power and invoked a dark magic spell that summoned a powerful demon lord. The lord offered to help her in exchange for her immortal soul. The witch agreed, and the two conspired to overthrow the current ruler of the underworld.\n\nThe witch and the demon lord succeeded in their plot and took control of the underworld. But the new ruler of the underworld was even more tyrannical and oppressive than the previous one. He demanded untold sacrifices from the demons and mistreated the witch.\n\nThe witch set herself to the task of regaining her power and overthrowing her new ruler. She used her magic to summon monsters, gather an army, and launch a rebellion. The witch and her followers fought bravely and ultimately succeeded in overthrowing the demon lord and regaining control of the underworld.\n\nThe witch was determined to rule justly and fairly, and she released all the demons who had been held captive by her predecessor. She established a new system of laws and punishments, and the underworld prospered under her reign.\n\nThe witch lived long and prosperously, ruling over the underworld for many years. She is remembered as a powerful and benevolent ruler, who brought justice and peace to the underworld.\n\nThe end.\n\nStory submitted by [User](https://www.storyscripter.com/users/26804639).

Binary trees are a type of data structure that consists of nodes, where each node has a value and zero or two children. They are commonly used to represent data hierarchically. In Python, we can create a binary tree using the `BinaryTree` class from the `data structures` module.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a binary tree using the `BinaryTree` class:\n```python\nfrom data_structures import BinaryTree\n\nroot = BinaryTree(2)\nroot.left = BinaryTree(1)\nroot.right = BinaryTree(3)\n```\nIn this example, we create a binary tree with a value of 2 at the root, and two children, left and right, which have values of 1 and 3, respectively. We can represent this binary tree using the following code:\n```python\nroot = BinaryTree(2)\nroot.left = BinaryTree(1)\nroot.right = BinaryTree(3)\n```\nWe can also traverse the tree using a traversal algorithm such as in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal. Here is an example of in-order traversal:\n```python\nin_order_traversal(root):\n    if root != None:\n        in_order_traversal(root.left)\n        print(root.value)\n        in_order_traversal(root.right)\n```\nIn this example, we use recursion to traverse the binary tree in in-order. We visit the left subtree, then visit the root, and finally visit the right subtree.\n\nWe can also perform operations such as inserting and deleting nodes, searching for a specific value in the tree, and performing arithmetic operations on the values of the nodes.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. \n=========================================\n```python\nclass BinaryTree:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\n    def left_traversal(self):\n        pass\n\n    def right_traversal(self):\n        pass\n```\nAgain, if you have", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 506, "completion_tokens": 483}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718387089.7444327, "last_token_time": 1718387171.5943859, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718387124.650384, "cpu_loading_time": 1718387124.6529865, "gpu_loading_time": 1718387124.6605072, "first_token_time": 1718387124.9066188, "time_in_queue": 34.905951261520386, "finished_time": 1718387171.5943353, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 11614601.516139146, "start_at": 11614519.659205377}

Choose the right technology stack - For building a search engine website, you would need a robust technology stack that includes an efficient database management system, a web server, and a programming language such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby.\n2. Design a scalable architecture - You should design your system to handle high traffic efficiently. You can use a microservices architecture where each service is responsible for a specific function, and deploy them independently, making it easier to scale up or down. You can also use a caching system like Redis or Memcached to reduce the load on your database and improve performance.\n3. Implement indexing and search algorithm - You should implement an indexing system that organizes the content on your website, making it searchable. This can be done using an indexing system like Solr or Elasticsearch, which can index content quickly and efficiently. Once the content is indexed, you can use a search algorithm like Google's while (Boolean), to search the indexed data efficiently.\n4. Optimize for performance - Optimizing your search engine website for performance is crucial. You should use techniques such as caching, query optimization, and server-side rendering to improve the response time of your website. You can also use a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute the load across multiple servers and improve the overall performance.\n5. Ensure data integrity - It is essential to ensure the integrity of the data stored on your website. You can use data consistency techniques such as versioning, concurrency control, and eventual consistency to ensure that the data is accurate and up-to-date at all times.\n6.

However, the attention mechanism in Transformers has quadratic time complexity in the sequence length, which limits the amount of context that can be accessed and bottlenecks the model's performance.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, researchers have developed various subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations to reduce the complexity of the attention mechanism. However, these methods require a tradeoff between expressivity and computational efficiency, and they often need to be combined with dense attention layers to achieve similar performance to Transformers. This combination can lead to increased computational costs and require more memory. Therefore, there is a need for alternative methods that maintain Transformer-level performance while being computationally efficient.\n\nIn this paper, the authors propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention that", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 294, "total_tokens": 535, "completion_tokens": 241}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718387035.034329, "last_token_time": 1718387359.4104936, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718387331.305357, "cpu_loading_time": 1718387331.3098025, "gpu_loading_time": 1718387331.3203118, "first_token_time": 1718387331.8142564, "time_in_queue": 296.2710280418396, "finished_time": 1718387359.4104831, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 11614789.338831196, "start_at": 11614464.946850104}

It is used to supply an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Factory Method pattern, on the other hand, is a creational design pattern which is used to encapsulate the creation of objects in a single algorithm. It involves creating an interface for creating an object, but allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that are created. The advantage of using Factory Method pattern is that it allows the factory to return an object of any type supported by the factory. The disadvantage is that it doesn't allow for factory-specified creation of objects with specific properties, like the Abstract Factory pattern. In the final analysis, the decision of which pattern to use depends on the specific requirements of the application.\n\n\ubc88\uc5ed\uacb0\uacfc  \n\ud328\ud134\uc740 \ucc3d\ucd9c \ud328\ud134 \uc124\uacc4 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud328\ud134\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb3c\uccb4\uac00 \ud2b9\uc815 \ud074\ub798\uc2a4\uc5d0 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc815\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud328\ud134\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb3c\uccb4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc790 \ud328\ud134\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc790\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc81c\uc57d", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 23, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens": 471}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718387218.4803634, "last_token_time": 1718387390.4047322, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718387331.305357, "cpu_loading_time": 1718387331.3097956, "gpu_loading_time": 1718387331.3203044, "first_token_time": 1718387331.8142564, "time_in_queue": 112.82499361038208, "finished_time": 1718387390.4046957, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 11614820.330267647, "start_at": 11614648.395553712}

Ghosts were said to whisper in your ear, knock over furniture in the middle of the night, and even cause possession in those who dared to enter.\nIt was this notoriety that had drawn paranormal investigator Penelope Radcliffe to the house. She was determined to study the strange occurrences and put an end to the fear that had gripped the neighborhood for so long.\nAs she explored the creaky floorboards and peered into the dark corners, Penelope couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and danger. But she tried to stay focused on her mission, collecting data and taking notes whenever something unusual happened.\nBut one night, as she lay in bed, she began to feel a strange sensation. It was as if her body was being pulled in a different direction. She tried to resist, but it only grew stronger, until she was forced to her feet.\nPenelope looked around, confused and overwhelmed, as the world began to spin. The room around her began to change, the furniture morphing into something unfamiliar. Finally, she stumbled out of the door, only to realize that she was no longer in the house.\nShe was in a vast, open space, surrounded by stars and a new moon. As she looked up in wonder, she saw a towering, shadowy being standing before her. It was unlike anything she had ever seen before, with tentacles and wings, and eyes that seemed to glow with an otherworldly light.\nShe tried to scream, but it was drowned out by a deafening roar. And then, a brilliant light filled the sky, blinding her. When she could see again, she was standing in the middle of her haunted house, back in her own body.\nBut it was not the same body she had before. She was no longer human, instead, she was a vessel for the being she had encountered in the other world. The entity had consumed her body, taking control of her mind and her actions.\nPenelope knew that she had to escape, to return to her normal life. But she was no longer in control. The being had a different plan for her, one that involved sacrifice and destruction on a cosmic scale.\nShe could only watch as she was drawn back into the haunted house, her new master leading her by the hand, and a feeling of hopelessness and despair began to overwhelm her.

The Sequences, in particular, have had a profound impact on my life and continue to shape my worldview. So, when the opportunity to write an article arguing that Eliezer Yudkowsky is the Ayn Rand of our times, I jumped at it.\n\nTo begin with, both Eliezer Yudkowsky and Ayn Rand are visionaries who have challenged traditional ideas about morality, rationality, and human nature. They have both championed the idea that individuals should strive to be rational and self-interested, and that society should be structured in a way that allows individuals to pursue their own goals without being held back by the collective.\n\nBut while Ayn Rand's Objectivism places a heavy emphasis on individualism and capitalism, Eliezer Yudkowsky's philosophy emphasizes the importance of cooperation and communication. He has long argued that human beings are not rational, self-interested beings by nature, but rather creatures who are capable of learning and adapting to their environment. This means that we must work together to build a world in which individuals can flourish.\n\nWhat's more, both Eliezer Yudkowsky and Ayn Rand have been deeply influential in their respective fields. Ayn Rand has had a profound impact on the world of business and politics, while Eliezer Yudkowsky has helped shape the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn short, Eliezer Yudkowsky is a visionary thinker who has made significant contributions to his field and whose ideas have had a profound impact on society. For these reasons, I believe that he is the Ayn Rand of our times.\n\nBut it's not just me who thinks so. Many other influential thinkers and writers have also praised Eliezer Yudkowsky's work. Steven Pinker, for example, has described him as a \"luminous mind\" who is capable of \"brilliant insights.\" Coraline Ada Ehmke has called him a \"master of complexity\" who \"sees the big picture\" and \"makes the hard problems seem solvable.\"\n\nSo if Eliezer Yudkowsky is the Ayn Rand of our times, then what does that mean for us? It means that we should take his ideas seriously and strive to build a world in which individuals can achieve their goals without being held back by the collective. It means that we should be rational and self-interested, but also that we should work together to build a better world.\n\nAnd it means that we should be open-minded and curious, always seeking out new ideas and", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 68, "total_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens": 598}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1718387119.7520564, "last_token_time": 1718387402.0890834, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1718387331.305357, "cpu_loading_time": 1718387331.3097968, "gpu_loading_time": 1718387331.3203058, "first_token_time": 1718387331.8142564, "time_in_queue": 211.55330061912537, "finished_time": 1718387402.0890765, "preempty_out_times": [], "preempty_in_times": []}]}, "end_at": 11614832.013900964, "start_at": 11614549.665966295}

In this way, transfinite numbers can be larger than infinity.\n\nAnother example is the concept of \"infinite sets\". In mathematics, a set is a collection of objects, such as numbers. An infinite set is a set that contains an infinite number of objects. For example, the set of all natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) is an infinite set.

The monarch's power is often absolute, although in some cases, such as the British system, the monarch has limited legal powers and is largely a symbolic figurehead. Monarchy can be a good form of government when a strong and just ruler is in power, but it can also lead to tyranny and abuse of power if the monarch is weak or corrupt.\n2. Aristocracy: This form of government is ruled by a select group of individuals, usually the wealthiest or most prominent members of society, known as the aristocracy. The aristocracy often has more power and influence than the general population, and often wields more political power than the monarch in a monarchy. This form of government can lead to an unequal distribution of wealth, power, and privilege, as well as limited opportunities for social mobility.\n3. Democracy: This form of government is ruled by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. In a democracy, various political institutions, such as a legislature, judiciary, and executive branch, are established to govern the people.

At the time, the Creditanstalt was one of the largest banks in Austria and a major financial institution in the international banking system.\n\nThe bankruptcy was caused by a combination of factors, including a large amount of bad loans made to businesses that were struggling during the Depression, as well as a lack of liquidity caused by the bank's tight ties to other financial institutions. The bank's collapse had a ripple effect throughout the global banking system, and it was a major factor in the economic downturn of the 1930s.\n\nThe Austrian government stepped in to bail out the bank's investors, but the bank was eventually liquidated and its assets and deposits transferred to a newly established bank, the Austrian National Bank. This bank ultimately played a key role in stabilizing the Austrian economy and helping to prevent the Depression from spiraling out of control.\n\nThe bankruptcy of the Creditanstalt serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible financial management and the potential consequences of financial instability.
