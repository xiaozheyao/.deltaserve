This is because the act of observing a particle affects its behavior, and any measurement involves disturbances that limit the precision of the measurement.\n\nQuantum mechanics also introduces the concept of superposition, which refers to the ability of particles to exist in multiple states at once.

Here is a function in Clojure that uses recursion to lazily compute the Fibonacci sequence:\n```clojure\n(defn fibonacci [n]\n  (if (= n 0)\n    0\n    (if (= n 1)\n      (next (fibonacci (- n 1)))\n      (next (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))\n```\nThis function takes an integer `n` and returns the `n`-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. It does this by recursion: it calls itself with `n` decremented by 1 if `n` is 1, and with `n` decremented by 2 otherwise. The `next` function is used to sequence the computation of the Fibonacci sequence, so that it is only computed up to the `n`-th element when it is needed.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```clojure\n(fibonacci 5)\n;; => 5\n\n(time (fibonacci 40))\n;; => \"Elapsed time: 9.002737 msecs\"\n;; => 8361287093724494393\n```\nIn this example, the expression `(next (fibonacci (- n 1)))` is optimized away in the first call, because `n` is 5, and `(next (fibonacci (- n 1)))` evaluates to `nil`. The second call takes longer because it computes the 40-th element of the Fibonacci sequence. The `time` function is used to measure the elapsed time, and the result is printed at the end of the computation.
