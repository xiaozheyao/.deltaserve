First, you need to create a new ExpressJS project. You can use the following command to create an ExpressJS project using `create-express-app`:\n```\nnpm init @my-app --view=ts\n```\n2. Next, you need to install the necessary packages. You can use the following command to install the packages:\n```\nnpm install --save express react react-dom\n```\n3. Once the packages are installed, you need to create a new file called `server.ts` in the root directory of the project. In this file, you can add the following code to create the ExpressJS server and serve the ReactJS app:\n```typescript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  const reactHtml = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);\n  res.send(`\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">${reactHtml}</div>\n        <script src=\"/client.js\"></script>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  `);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server listening on port 3000...');\n});\n```\nIn this code, we first import the necessary packages and create an ExpressJS server. Then we add a new route to the server that listens to the root path (`/'`) and serves the ReactJS app. The `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` function is used to convert the React component to HTML.

The `a` and `b` variables represent the current and previous Fibonacci numbers, respectively. The `remaining` variable holds the index of the next number to compute in the sequence. The loop continues until the `remaining` variable is zero.\n\nThe `take` function is used to limit the number of Fibonacci numbers generated. In this example, only the first 10 numbers are returned. You can change the argument to `take` to generate more or fewer numbers in the sequence.\n\nThis function is lazy, meaning it will only compute the next number in the sequence as needed.
