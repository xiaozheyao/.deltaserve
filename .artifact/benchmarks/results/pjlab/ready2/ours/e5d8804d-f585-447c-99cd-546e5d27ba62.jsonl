The `if` statements check if `n` is equal to 0 or 1, and return the appropriate value. Otherwise, the function calls itself recursively with lower values of `n`, and uses `lazy-seq` to compute the Fibonacci sequence in a lazy manner.\n\nHere are some examples of how this function can be used:\n```clojure\n(fibonacci 10) ; => (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55)\n```\nNote that the `fibonacci` function returns a lazy sequence, so it doesn't actually compute all the Fibonacci numbers until they are demanded by the calling code. This can be useful for avoiding computationally expensive calculations until they are needed.\n```clojure\n(time (take 100 (fibonacci 100))) ; => \"Elapsed time: 1.940577 msecs\"\n```\nThis code will only demand the first 100 Fibonacci numbers, and will take more than a second to run due to the recursive calls.
