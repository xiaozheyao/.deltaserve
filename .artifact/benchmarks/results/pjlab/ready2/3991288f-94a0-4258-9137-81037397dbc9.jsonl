The sudden collapse of the core triggers a massive explosion that can result in the formation of a neutron star or black hole.\n2.

Here's one way to write a lazily computed Fibonacci sequence in Clojure:\n```clojure\n(defn fibonacci [n]\n  (loop [a 1 b 2 current-sum a]\n    (if (= current-sum n)\n      current-sum\n      (recur (+ a b) (+ a current-sum) (+ a current-sum)))))\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n* `fibonacci` is a recurser that takes in a number `n`, and uses a loop to compute the nth Fibonacci number.\n* The loop starts with `a` set to 1 and `b` set to 2.\n* The loop continues as long as `current-sum` is less than `n`.\n* At each step of the loop, `current-sum` is computed by adding `a` and `b` together, then adding `a` again. This mimics the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence: `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.\n* When `current-sum` reaches `n`, the loop terminates and returns `current-sum`.\n\nSince this function uses laziness to compute the Fibonacci sequence, it only computes as many terms of the sequence as needed. For example, if you wanted to compute the 5th Fibonacci number, the function would compute the first two terms and then add them together to get the 3rd term. It would then add the 3rd term to the 4th term to get the 5th term, all without needing to compute any more terms than necessary. This can be useful in systems where you need to compute a large number of Fibonacci numbers, and don't want to waste memory or processing power by computing all of them at once.\n\nHope that helps", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens": 419}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715940071.2618062, "last_token_time": 1715940911.5940037, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715940072.4132054, "cpu_loading_time": 1715940072.416099, "gpu_loading_time": 1715940072.4161127, "first_token_time": 1715940088.2074375, "time_in_queue": 1.1513991355895996, "finished_time": 1715940911.5939815}]}, "end_at": 20750780.645064034, "start_at": 20749921.926330253}

It can also help prevent the spread of misinformation and fake news that can have serious consequences. For example, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media censorship can help prevent the spread of misinformation that can lead to harmful health outcomes.\n\nMoreover, social media censorship can help preserve the privacy and safety of individuals, particularly minors. Social media censorship can help prevent the exposure of personal information, such as contact details or location, that can make individuals vulnerable to physical harm.\n\nFinally, social media censorship can help to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. For example, social media platforms may be required to remove content that violates copyright or intellectual property laws.\n\nArgument against social media censorship:\nSocial media censorship can be counter-productive and can infringe on freedom of expression, which is a fundamental right. Censorship can also create an echo chamber, where individuals are only exposed to content that reinforces their existing beliefs, rather than being exposed to a diverse range of viewpoints.\n\nMoreover, social media censorship can be difficult to implement and can be subjective. What one person considers to be offensive may not be considered offensive by another. This can lead to inconsistent and arbitrary censorship, which can undermine trust in social media platforms.\n\nFinally, social media censorship can be used as a tool of repression, particularly in authoritarian regimes. Governments can use social media censorship to silence dissent and control the narrative, which can have serious consequences for human rights.\n\nIn summary, social media censorship has both advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to carefully consider the implications of censorship before making a decision.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, we have:\n\nh\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2\n\nwhere b is the leg adjacent to the altitude.\n\nGiven that the altitude divides the hypotenuse into segments with lengths in the ratio 1:2, we know that:\n\na + b = h / 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives us:\n\n2a + 2b = h\n\nNow, we can substitute for a and b using the Pythagorean theorem and our given information:\n\n2a + 2b = h\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = h\u00b2\n\n6\u00b2 = 2h\u00b2\n\n36 = 2h\u00b2\n\nh\u00b2 = 18\nh = \u221a18 = 3\u221a2\n\nTherefore, the hypotenuse is 3\u221a2 cm in length.\n\nTo get the other leg, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\na\u00b2 = h\u00b2 - b\u00b2\n\na\u00b2 = 18 - (3\u221a2)\u00b2\n\na\u00b2 = 18 - 9\n\na\u00b2 = 9\n\na = \u221a9 = 3\n\nTherefore, the leg opposite the altitude is 3 cm, and the leg adjacent to the altitude is:\n\nb = Hypotenuse - leg opposite the altitude\nb = 3\u221a2 - 3\nb = (3\u221a2) - 1\n\nSo the leg adjacent to the altitude is 2\u221a2 cm in length.
