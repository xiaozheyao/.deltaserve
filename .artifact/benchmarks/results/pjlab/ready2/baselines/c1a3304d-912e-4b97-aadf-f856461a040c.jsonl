Some of the most advanced supercomputer systems include Japan's Tsukuba TSUBA supercomputer, China's Sunway TaihuLight, the US's Summit and Sierra, among others.\nThese advanced AI systems run large statistical and machine learning algorithms on massive data distributed across thousands of computers and servers. For example, in 2015 findings about AI's ability to outperform humans at chess were made public as Google's Deepmind project was put in a chess match against Gary Kasparov in 1997's \"Kasparov vs. the World.\"\nCould you explain what \"Sunway TaihuLight\" is?\nI think the AI will not be a risk for the humans in 2100. As we're bound by the 2nd law of thermodynamics while an artificial being will not.\nSo we'll never be able to create a perfect machine, it would be rather easy for a smart machine to overpower us at any given time.\nEvery", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens": 268}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715935475.9528213, "last_token_time": 1715935965.8078313, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715935505.105331, "cpu_loading_time": 1715935537.1413317, "gpu_loading_time": 1715935539.1600032, "first_token_time": 1715935669.8782496, "time_in_queue": 29.152509689331055, "finished_time": 1715935965.8076472}]}, "end_at": 17294749.837919652, "start_at": 17294259.973573428}

The user doesn\u2019t have the time to understand the complexity of a method. The user just wants to manipulate things that most interest her. She WANTS to give input, use services in some way, be told what she needs to know and workers WANT to receive the skillset they ask for. They ask neither of an API, nor a script, person, nor whether the results are convenient. Scaling to billions of users scattered around the globe is a realistic and reasonable possibility for people who own domain skills and desire to do the same.\nA mindset shift?\nKnowledge workers represent the top 1% of most developed countries. People who can be defined as Workers (people who WANT and have the skills needed) have a strong desire to transform the world to make it a little better for us.
