The following year, Bohr took a major risk in publishing this paper in the British journal Philosophical Magazine on a pioneering theory that, along with Planck's quantum theory of black body radiation, became the textbook theory of quantum physics. While the wave formulation of the theory potentially allowed the extension of classical mechanics into domains it worked well for, Heisenberg introduced a quantum formalism of operators that created much more freedom, making the thought experiments more complicated to follow. The new mathematical formalism enabled physicists to manipulate quantum particles into new forms without suffering any degradation of their energy and information content. The key to this formalism is that the momentum and energy of quantum particles are only described, rather than determined exactly, during such interactions, and that their uncertainty is described as the root of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\nHeisenberg's formalism was an extraordinary extension to quantum physics.
