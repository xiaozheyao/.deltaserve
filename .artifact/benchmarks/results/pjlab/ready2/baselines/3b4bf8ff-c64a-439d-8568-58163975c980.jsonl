An old man with a beard, wearing a white apron, brings the hot dish with the dragon to the table. It's flamb\u00e9\u00e9d, and its aroma of concludes the experience. He comes with a nice carafe of water at the edge of the table, he drinks it in one breath to prove nothing was wrong with the food. Meanwhile, back on Earth, a comment posted on Facebook warned that the dragon might be a fake, and a director published mandatory memo on YouTube about potential recalling and law suit should people discover it was false, but no one can hear it out in space.\nASSISTANT: Name Troy cake with medical jelly hotmoonshine: a sweet, tangy, and soft piece of cake involving Gu", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "total_tokens": 339, "completion_tokens": 318}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715940209.6047566, "last_token_time": 1715942818.7940812, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715942344.0082119, "cpu_loading_time": 1715942375.8798552, "gpu_loading_time": 1715942377.9751995, "first_token_time": 1715942384.533602, "time_in_queue": 2134.4034552574158, "finished_time": 1715942818.794038}]}, "end_at": 3911192.746261143, "start_at": 3908583.549212226}

The fundamental assumption was the smartphone itself can\u2019t add much to the user experience. It is the combination of the smartphone and the engineering behind the smartphone (such as ARKit) that makes augmented writing feasible. Given this combination, then Anita Borg asked: What would Google do? We all start by imagining what Google has always done. It\u2019s a culture of technology for the masses. A core question is, how do we make something difficult like writing and easy with technology.\nThus Google does a smart and clever trick in the way it updates our operating assumptions.
