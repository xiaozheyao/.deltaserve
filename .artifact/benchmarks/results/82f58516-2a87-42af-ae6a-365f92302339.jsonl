This will determine the type of features and capabilities you need to include in your arena.\n4. Set up the infrastructure: Depending on the platform you choose, you may need to set up servers, databases, and other infrastructure components. Make sure you have the necessary technical skills and resources to set up and maintain the infrastructure.\n5.
