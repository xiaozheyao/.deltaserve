It is a probabilistic theory that replaces the classical wave-particle duality by describing the behavior of the particles as a wave-like interference pattern of overlapping quantum states, known as wavefunction. The wavefunction describes the probability of finding the particle in a given location at any given time, and its evolution is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nIn quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, and their behavior is influenced by the observer. It also predicts phenomena such as entanglement, where two particles can be connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.\nIn summary, quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework that describes the behavior of particles and energy at the atomic and subatomic level, and it is the foundation of many modern technologies, including lasers, transistors, and computer chips.
