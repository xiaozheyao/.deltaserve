Math.abs() does not return a negative integer. It instead returns 0 which has the same properties as positive zero except it is indistinguishable from not putting a position/value in that cell. So I would have preferred ellipse for instance but that would be alot more lines of code rather than a simple shorthand. 2. It is generally a bad habit to rely on implicit types in JS. If document.execCommand() is ever updated and can manipulate canvas elements the following framework would've been broken on that coat of paint. Could've easily done var coord = ellipse.getBoundingClientRect() and used that to get the center of the ellipseobject. Also if you're using <1.8 (unlikely these days, but still not incredibly likely) then you are in trouble now that you've added the element to the DOM. There are a couple ways to deal with this issue. The most portable way is to add a listener to the element during DOM mutation. This means you'll need to export a readding_ellipse_event_listener() kind of function and be sure to unbind it before removing the element: var element = document.getElementById('svg'); var [px, py, ..., element.addEventListener", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens": 411}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715776632.4825828, "last_token_time": 1715777555.1938367, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715776644.8023226, "cpu_loading_time": 1715776644.8070915, "gpu_loading_time": 1715776644.807131, "first_token_time": 1715776957.474938, "time_in_queue": 12.319739818572998, "finished_time": 1715777555.1937935}]}, "end_at": 10995468.157929428, "start_at": 10994545.43505341}

To understand PEFT, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of parallelization with deep learning models. You may want to look at my other card, Cross Lingual Transfer on BYJU\u2019S Watcut for a better understanding o.\nIn the context of deep learning models, parallelization refers to running the same learning on multiple instances of the same model at the same time. This can be done in both software and hardware. On BYJU\u2019S Watcut for example, there are 10 GPU\u2019s running approximately 10 identical but slightly different models. What does this do? It essentially allows for the training of the model. With smaller models you can scale for example with 16 machines but because of the heavier model size, you typically need more robust infrastructure like 10 GPU\u2019s to achieve this level of parallelization.\nWhat is PEFT then?\nPEFT is another way of producing similar", "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length", "stop_reason": null}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 249, "completion_tokens": 225}, "metrics": [{"arrival_time": 1715776623.5807052, "last_token_time": 1715777873.3723013, "start_loading_time": null, "first_scheduled_time": 1715777477.5089917, "cpu_loading_time": 1715777509.3751886, "gpu_loading_time": 1715777511.4232101, "first_token_time": 1715777523.948631, "time_in_queue": 853.9282865524292, "finished_time": 1715777873.372274}]}, "end_at": 10995786.331436934, "start_at": 10994536.533210507}
